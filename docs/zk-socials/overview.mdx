# ZK Socials

## What is ZK Socials?

ZK Socials is a privacy-preserving solution that utilizes zkTLS to establish ZK Registries based on Web2 data. This makes it ideal for use cases such as bridging credentials from the legacy web to Web3.

## Why ZK Socials?

While zkTLS solutions provide a secure way to generate attestations of Web2 data, they often come with a complex user experience. Integrating these attestations into a ZK Registry makes them instantly reusable, composable, and anonymous, significantly enhancing usability.

## How does it work?

Using ZK Socials follows these steps:
1. The user obtains an attestation via a zkTLS protocol of their choice.
1. The user submits a ZK proof of attestation's validity to a permissionless ZK Registry, which verifies it on-chain and records it in the registry.
1. Once the attestation is stored, the user can generate ZK proofs of inclusion for any DApps that require them.

## Use case: X Blue Checkmark registry

A prediction market <OutLink href="https://openion.com/">Openion</OutLink> has integrated ZK Socials to check X Blue Checkmarks. To withdraw rewards, users must verify their X account using zkPass and submit a ZK proof of membership in the Blue Checkmark ZK Registry.
