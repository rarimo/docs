# Using Rarimo’s Proof of Humanity Plugin for Galxe

## Why Proof of Human?

Community-building platforms like Galxe facilitate reward-based loyalty programs for crypto projects. Such platforms are prone to abuse by bots and fake accounts. Currently, there are a few ways to address this issue:

- Captchas;
- Linking social media accounts;
- Self-Sovereign Identity protocols(SSI);
- Reputation systems;

However, neither of these covers the entire Web3 user base. Also, they are tricky to integrate into a Galxe campaign.

Rarimo’s Proof of Human plugin improves upon these solutions by aggregating identity providers and facilitating zero-knowledge identity proofs on-chain. This way, users can choose from many options for proving their humanity while keeping their privacy.
