# Subgraph Reference

Subgraph indexes the verified users from the `SBTIdentityVerifier` contract and serves the data via a GraphQL API.

## Deployments

GraphQL endpoints:

- Mainnet(indexes events from Polygon): https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/volodymyrzolotukhin/sbtidentityverifier-polygon/graphql

- Testnet(indexes events from Goerli testnet): https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/volodymyrzolotukhin/sbtidentityverifier/graphql

## Querying

The subgraph contains the following entity:

```graphql
type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  senderAddr: Bytes!
  tokenAddr: Bytes!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}
```

Use the following query (you should provide the sender address):

```graphql
query info($address: String!) {
  users(where: { senderAddr: $address }) {
    id
  }
}
```

A non-empty response like this indicates that the user is verified:

```json
    {
        "users": [
            {
                "id": ":"19643409028078272448762374992644569744201332795590556384983511405206634497"
            }
        ]
    }
```

## Data Source

The subgraph ingests the following events:

```solidity
event SBTIdentityProved(
    uint256 indexed identityId,
    address senderAddr,
    address tokenAddr,
    uint256 tokenID
)
```

- `identityID` - identity identifier
- `senderAddr` - sender (of the transaction) address
- `tokenAddr` - address of the Souldbound token
- `tokenID` - ID of the token that was issued to the user after he passed identity verification

The subgraph stores the same information plus the transaction hash.
