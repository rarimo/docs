# API Reference

## Subgraph

Subgraph indexes the verified users from the `SBTIdentityVerifier` contract and serves the data via a GraphQL API.

### Deployments

GraphQL endpoints:

- Mainnet(indexes events from Polygon): https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/volodymyrzolotukhin/sbtidentityverifier-polygon/graphql

- Testnet(indexes events from Goerli testnet): https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/volodymyrzolotukhin/sbtidentityverifier/graphql

### Querying

The subgraph contains the following entity:

```graphql
type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  senderAddr: Bytes!
  tokenAddr: Bytes!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}
```

Use the following query (you should provide the sender address):

```graphql
query info($address: String!) {
  users(where: { senderAddr: $address }) {
    id
  }
}
```

A non-empty response like this indicates that the user is verified:

```json
    {
        "users": [
            {
                "id": ":"19643409028078272448762374992644569744201332795590556384983511405206634497"
            }
        ]
    }
```

### Data Source

The subgraph ingests the following events:

```solidity
event SBTIdentityProved(
    uint256 indexed identityId,
    address senderAddr,
    address tokenAddr,
    uint256 tokenID
)
```

- `identityID` - identity identifier
- `senderAddr` - sender (of the transaction) address
- `tokenAddr` - address of the Souldbound token
- `tokenID` - ID of the token that was issued to the user after he passed identity verification

The subgraph stores the same information plus the transaction hash.

## Provider Packages

The Rarimo SDK provider packages provide tools to interact with in-browser wallets.

For information about connecting to wallets, see [Connecting to wallets](/tutorials/connecting-to-wallets).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

### @rarimo/provider

The [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package provides a common interface for access to wallets (EVM and non-EVM) to you can work with different wallets with similar code.

### Blockchain-specific providers

These packages provide tools to connect to specific types of wallets:

- [@rarimo/providers-evm](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_evm.html): access to Metamask and Coinbase wallets on EVM-compatible chains via the [`MetamaskProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_evm.MetamaskProvider.html) and [`CoinbaseProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_evm.CoinbaseProvider.html) classes
- [@rarimo/providers-near](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_near.html): access to NEAR wallets on the NEAR chain via the [`NearProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_near.NearProvider.html) class
- [@rarimo/providers-solana](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_solana.html): access to Phantom and Solflare wallets on the Solana chain via the [`PhantomProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_solana.PhantomProvider.html) and [`SolflareProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_solana.SolflareProvider.html) classes

The classes that represent specific types of wallets all implement the [`IProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html) interface, which allows you to work with different wallet types in a consistent way.
In this way, each provider has these main methods:

- [`connect()`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html#connect): Connects to the wallet, prompting the user to log in if necessary.

After you connect, you can access information about the wallet with these properties of the provider object:

- `address`: The wallet address
- `providerType`: The type of wallet, such as `metamask`
- `chainType`: The type of chain from the [`ChainTypes`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/enums/_rarimo_shared.ChainTypes.html) enumeration, such as EVM, Near, or Solana

Here is an example that creates a MetamaskProvider object for a MetaMask wallet on an EVM-compatible chain and prints information about it:

```ts
import { createProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'

const getMetamaskWalletAddress = async () => {
  // Connect to the Metamask wallet in the browser, using the MetamaskProvider interface to limit bundle size.
  const provider = await createProvider(MetamaskProvider)
  await provider.connect()

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

Many other methods and properties are available.
For complete information about providers, see the [@rarimo/provider](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_provider.html) SDK reference and the reference for the chain-specific packages.

### @rarimo/react-provider

The [@rarimo/react-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-provider) package provides access to in-browser wallets in React applications.

This package supports the same chain and wallet types as the [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package and the chain-specific packages.
However, instead of using the `createProvider()` function, you use the `useProvider()` function in React applications, as in this example

```ts
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'
import { useProvider } from '@rarimo/react-provider'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

function App() {
  const { provider, ...rest } = useProvider(MetamaskProvider)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connectToProvider = async () => {
      await provider.connect()
    }
    if (!provider) connectToProvider()
    if (provider?.address) console.log(provider.address)
  }, [provider])

  return <div className="App">Wallet address: {provider?.address}</div>
}

export default App
```
