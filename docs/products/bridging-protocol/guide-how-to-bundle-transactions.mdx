# Guide: How to bundle EVM transactions

Rarimo's multichain protocol bundles multiple related events into single contract calls or transactions.
In this way, the protocol simplifies complex, multistep user actions.

Bundling also allows Rarimo to include custom logic with transactions.
Rarimo contracts use this logic to run actions that follow an initial transaction, such as unlocking tokens on other chains and buying NFTs by calling other contracts.

When a transaction locks a token in a Rarimo contract, users can specify additional contracts and methods to call on the destination chain.
The Rarimo contract signs and runs these additional transactions automatically.
Methods that call custom contracts are not overridable, which protects transactions from re-entrancy attacks.

## Example

This high-level example demonstrates how bundling can simplify a user flow:

Alice has an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
They want to stake this NFT in a DeFi application on the Polygon blockchain.
Normally, staking an NFT requires multiple transactions:

1. Lock the NFT on the Ethereum network.
1. Redeem the NFT on the Polygon network.
1. Stake the NFT in the DeFi application.

Separately, each of these transactions incur gas fees and can fail independently.
This is why we designed Rarimo to bundle transactions on the destination chain.
Our bundled transactions handle these steps efficiently with a single request, incurring a single gas fee and behaving atomically.

## Benefits

- Bundled transactions have a lower gas cost than the individual transactions.
- Transactions on the destination chain succeed or fail together.
- Bundling transactions makes your development flow simpler.
- Any address can handle transaction calls and gas fees on behalf of the original requestor.

## Limitations

- Transaction bundling works only with EVM networks.
- ERC1155 token transfers cannot use bundling.

## Creating bundled transactions

To bundle transactions together with the SDK, follow these general steps.
For a complete example, see [SDK](/products/bridging-protocol/js-sdk-reference).

1. Connect to a wallet and create a transaction operation with the <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/functions/_rarimo_nft_checkout.createCheckoutOperation.html">`createCheckoutOperation()`</OutLink> function:

   ```ts
   import {
     createCheckoutOperation,
     EVMOperation,
     CheckoutOperationParams,
   } from '@rarimo/nft-checkout'
   import { createProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
   import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'

   const addTransactionToBundle = async () => {
     const provider = await createProvider(MetamaskProvider)
     const op = createCheckoutOperation(EVMOperation, provider)
     // ...
   }
   ```

1. Initialize the operation as usual with the operation object's <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_nft_checkout.CheckoutOperation.html#init"> `init()`(</OutLink> method.
   This step assumes that you have set the target transaction and chain for the operation as described in [SDK](/products/bridging-protocol/js-sdk-reference):

   ```ts
   const params: CheckoutOperationParams = {
     chainIdFrom: selectedChain!.id,
     chainIdTo: destinationChain!.id,
     price: Price.fromRaw('0.01', 18, 'ETH'),
   }

   await op.init(params)
   ```

1. Use the <OutLink href="https://ethers.org/">Ethers</OutLink> interface to encode a transaction.
   This transaction accepts the receiver's address as a parameter, buys the NFT, and sends it to the receiver's address:

   ```ts
   const encodedFunctionData = new utils.Interface([
     'function buy(address receiver_) payable',
   ]).encodeFunctionData('buy', [USER_WALLET_ADDRESS])
   ```

1. Add the transaction to the bundle with the Ethers `utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode()` function.
   The function takes these two parameters:

   - An array of the Solidity types that Rarimo passes, which are:

     - The NFT contract address that Rarimo calls to buy the NFT, which is `address[]`
     - The calculated price of the NFT on the destination chain, which is `uint256[]`
     - The encoded NFT contract buy function, which is `bytes[]`

   - An array that includes the NFT contract address, the price of the NFT, and the encoded function.

   Here is an example:

   ```ts
   // Address of the NFT sale contract
   const NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x77fedfb705c8bac2e03aad2ad8a8fe83e3e20fa1'

   const bundle = utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
     ['address[]', 'uint256[]', 'bytes[]'],
     [
       [NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS],
       [priceOfNft],
       [encodeBuyFunctionCall(USER_WALLET_ADDRESS)],
     ]
   )
   ```

   To bundle multiple transactions, add their NFT contract addresses, prices, and encoded functions to the respective arrays.
   For example, this code bundles two functions:

   ```ts
   const bundle = utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
     ['address[]', 'uint256[]', 'bytes[]'],
     [
       [NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_A, NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_B],
       [priceOfNftA, priceOfNftB],
       [
         encodeBuyFunctionCallA(USER_WALLET_ADDRESS_A),
         encodeBuyFunctionCallB(USER_WALLET_ADDRESS_B),
       ],
     ]
   )
   ```

1. Call the operation's <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_nft_checkout.CheckoutOperation.html#checkout">`checkout()`</OutLink> method to run the transaction:

   ```ts
   const txHash = await op.checkout(estimatedPrice, { bundle })
   ```
