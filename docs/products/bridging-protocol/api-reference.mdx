# API Reference

The Rarimo SDK checkout packages provide tools to send transactions to blockchains.

For information about creating transactions, see [Creating NFT checkout transactions](/products/bridging-protocol/creating-nft-checkout-transactions).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

## @rarimo/nft-checkout

The [@rarimo/nft-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/nft-checkout) package provides tools that swap tokens and create cross-chain transactions based on the Rarimo protocol.

For information about swapping tokens, see [Swapping tokens](/products/bridging-protocol/swapping-tokens).

## @rarimo/react-nft-checkout

The [@rarimo/react-nft-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-nft-checkout) package provides React components that you can use in your UI to create cross-chain transactions with the Rarimo protocol.

For information about creating transactions with this package, see [Creating NFT checkout transactions](/products/bridging-protocol/creating-nft-checkout-transactions).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

### React transaction flow

The transaction flow starts with the `DappContextProvider` and `RarimoPayButton` components:

When a user clicks the button, the `RarimoPayDialog` component opens, prompting the user to select the wallet to use.
It includes the `PaymentWallets` and `CheckoutModal` components, which list the wallets detected in the browser:

![The Rarimo pay dialog, with an embedded list of wallets](/img/sdk/RarimoPayDialog-wallets.png)

When the user selects a wallet and logs in to it, the `RarimoPayDialog` component shows the `BridgeChainSelect` component, which prompts the user to select a chain:

![The Rarimo pay dialog, with a list of chains](/img/sdk/RarimoPayDialog-chains.png)

When the user selects a chain, the dialog updates to show the tokens in the wallet in the `PaymentTokensList` component:

![The Rarimo pay dialog, with an embedded list of tokens in the selected wallet and chain](/img/sdk/RarimoPayDialog-tokens.png)

When the user clicks a token, the dialog opens a `LoadingIndicator` component as it retrieves prices.
Then the dialog shows the price of the transaction and the fees involved.

If the wallet has enough of the selected token, the dialog shows the transaction fees and prompts the user to complete the transaction, as in this example:

The Rarimo SDK provider packages provide tools to interact with in-browser wallets.

For information about connecting to wallets, see [Connecting to wallets](/products/bridging-protocol/connecting-to-wallets).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

### @rarimo/provider

The [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package provides a common interface for access to wallets (EVM and non-EVM) to you can work with different wallets with similar code.

### Blockchain-specific providers

These packages provide tools to connect to specific types of wallets:

- [@rarimo/providers-evm](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_evm.html): access to Metamask and Coinbase wallets on EVM-compatible chains via the [`MetamaskProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_evm.MetamaskProvider.html) and [`CoinbaseProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_evm.CoinbaseProvider.html) classes
- [@rarimo/providers-near](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_near.html): access to NEAR wallets on the NEAR chain via the [`NearProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_near.NearProvider.html) class
- [@rarimo/providers-solana](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_providers_solana.html): access to Phantom and Solflare wallets on the Solana chain via the [`PhantomProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_solana.PhantomProvider.html) and [`SolflareProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_providers_solana.SolflareProvider.html) classes

The classes that represent specific types of wallets all implement the [`IProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html) interface, which allows you to work with different wallet types in a consistent way.
In this way, each provider has these main methods:

- [`connect()`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html#connect): Connects to the wallet, prompting the user to log in if necessary.

After you connect, you can access information about the wallet with these properties of the provider object:

- `address`: The wallet address
- `providerType`: The type of wallet, such as `metamask`
- `chainType`: The type of chain from the [`ChainTypes`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/enums/_rarimo_shared.ChainTypes.html) enumeration, such as EVM, Near, or Solana

Here is an example that creates a MetamaskProvider object for a MetaMask wallet on an EVM-compatible chain and prints information about it:

```ts
import { createProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'

const getMetamaskWalletAddress = async () => {
  // Connect to the Metamask wallet in the browser, using the MetamaskProvider interface to limit bundle size.
  const provider = await createProvider(MetamaskProvider)
  await provider.connect()

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

Many other methods and properties are available.
For complete information about providers, see the [@rarimo/provider](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_provider.html) SDK reference and the reference for the chain-specific packages.

### @rarimo/react-provider

The [@rarimo/react-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-provider) package provides access to in-browser wallets in React applications.

This package supports the same chain and wallet types as the [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package and the chain-specific packages.
However, instead of using the `createProvider()` function, you use the `useProvider()` function in React applications, as in this example

```ts
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'
import { useProvider } from '@rarimo/react-provider'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

function App() {
  const { provider, ...rest } = useProvider(MetamaskProvider)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connectToProvider = async () => {
      await provider.connect()
    }
    if (!provider) connectToProvider()
    if (provider?.address) console.log(provider.address)
  }, [provider])

  return <div className="App">Wallet address: {provider?.address}</div>
}

export default App
```
