# Connecting to Wallets

You can connect to browser-based wallets such as Metamask with the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.
See the following sections:

- [Connecting to wallets in JavaScript/TypeScript applications](#javascript)
- [Connecting to wallets in React applications](#react-applications)

## Examples

These examples show how to connect to wallets:

- The example [wallet-access](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) shows how to connect to a wallet without using React.
- The example [wallet-access-react](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/tree/main/wallet-access-react) shows how to connect to a wallet in a React application.

## Connecting to wallets in JavaScript/TypeScript applications {#javascript}

Rarimo provides several packages for interacting with wallets on different blockchains:

- The [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package provides a common interface for interacting with wallets, so you can work with different types of wallets and blockchains with similar code.
- Packages that are specific to blockchain types, which provide tools for accessing wallets and interacting with them on blockchains.

To connect to a wallet, first use the `createProvider()` function to create the appropriate class of provider object, which represents the wallet.

Then, run the object's `connect()` method to prompt the user to log in to the wallet.
This connect step runs automatically if you initiate a transaction with the provider object.

Here is an example that creates a MetamaskProvider object for a MetaMask wallet on an EVM-compatible chain and prints information about it:

```ts
import { ChainTypes } from '@rarimo/shared'
import { createProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'

const getMetamaskWalletAddress = async () => {
  // Connect to the Metamask wallet in the browser, using the MetamaskProvider interface to limit bundle size.
  const provider = await createProvider(MetamaskProvider)
  await provider.connect()

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

For information about the wallets that the SDK supports and other things that you can do with wallet providers, see [Provider packages](/products/base-layer/api-reference).

As an alternative to using the wallet-specific provider types, you can connect to EVM wallets via ethers.js with this code:

```ts
import { ChainTypes } from '@rarimo/shared'
import { Provider, Providers } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { EthersProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'
import { providers } from 'ethers'

const getEVMWalletAddress = async () => {
  const web3Provider = new providers.Web3Provider(
    window.ethereum as providers.ExternalProvider,
    'any'
  )
  const provider = new Provider(EthersProvider)
  await provider.init({
    name: Providers.Ethers,
    instance: web3Provider,
  })

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

As an alternative to using the wallet-specific provider types, you can connect to EVM wallets via ethers.js with this code:

```ts
import { ChainTypes } from '@rarimo/shared'
import { Provider, Providers } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { EthersProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'
import { providers } from 'ethers'

const getEVMWalletAddress = async () => {
  const web3Provider = new providers.Web3Provider(
    window.ethereum as providers.ExternalProvider,
    'any'
  )
  const provider = new Provider(EthersProvider)
  await provider.init({
    name: Providers.Ethers,
    instance: web3Provider,
  })

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

## Connecting to wallets in React applications {#react-applications}

The [@rarimo/react-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-provider) package provides the `useProvider` hook, which allows React applications to access wallets.

To connect to a wallet, import the `useProvider` hook create the appropriate wallet provider object from the [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package.
Then you can use the provider object to get information about the wallet or run transactions with it, as in this example:

```ts
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/providers-evm'
import { useProvider } from '@rarimo/react-provider'

function App() {
  const { provider, ...rest } = useProvider(MetamaskProvider)

  provider?.connect()
  console.log(provider?.address)

  return <div className="App">Wallet address: {provider?.address}</div>
}

export default App
```
