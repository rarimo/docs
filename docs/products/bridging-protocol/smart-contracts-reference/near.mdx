# Near

The NEAR Bridge Contracts provide deposit and withdrawal functions for native, fungible, and non-fungible tokens.

You can view the contracts directly on [github](https://github.com/rarimo/near-contracts/tree/main).
This page is a quick reference for the interface and capabilities of this contract.

## General Notes

### Emitted Events

Each of these methods will emit an event in a standardized way.
For example, when called, the `native_deposit` will emit a `native_deposited` event. All parameters passed in will be part of the emitted event in the same order.

### Commissions

NEAR executes transactions asynchronously so that commission can be paid in any order (before or after the deposit). The contract will ensure all requirements are met to transfer the deposit to the bridge contract.
It is recommended to pay the commission first and then place the deposit.

## `storage_deposit`

### Interface

```rust
fn storage_deposit(
  &mut self,
  account_id: Option<AccountId>,
  registration_only: Option<bool>
)
```

### Parameters

- `account_id` account id, which will use the bridge
- `registration_only` optional parameter, if set to true, then it will first check whether the address has already paid for the storage, and if yes - will not consume attached funds

NEAR requires a bit of native NEARs (0.00663 in this case) for storing data.

### Example

```shell
near call $FEE storage_deposit '{"account_id": "'$ID'"}' --accountId $ID --amount 0.00663
```

Note that `$FEE` should be replaced with the address of the fee token contract.

## `charge_native`

### Interface

```rust
pub fn charge_native(
  &mut self,
  deposit: DepositLog,
)

pub struct DepositLog {
  pub fee_token_addr: Option<AccountId>,
  pub token_addr: Option<AccountId>,
  pub token_type: TokenType,
  pub transfer_type: TransferType,
  pub receiver: String,
  pub chain_to: String,
  pub is_wrapped: bool,
  pub bundle_data: Option<String>,
  pub bundle_salt: Option<String>,
}
```

### Parameters

- `fee_token_addr` address of used fee token (empty for native NEAR)
- `token_addr` address of the token being deposited
- `token_type` type of token being deposited (Native, FT, or NFT)
- `transfer_type` type of transfer (deposit or fee)
- `receiver` receiver address at the destination chain
- `chain_to` destination chain
- `is_wrapped` boolean value, which shows whether the bridge wraps the token
- `bundle_data` encoded transaction bundle
- `bundle_hash` hash for decoding the bundle and determining the addresses

### Example

```shell
# pay the USDC fee to the feer contract
near call $USDC ft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$FEE'", "amount": "1", "msg": "{\"fee_token_addr\":\"'$USDC'\",\"token_type\":\"Native\",\"transfer_type\":\"Fee\",\"receiver\":\"'$ID'\",\"chain_to\":\"Near\",\"is_wrapped\":false}"}' --accountId $ID --gas 300000000000000 --depositYocto 1

# deposit native to feer contract (change amount according to required deposit)
near call $FEE charge_native '{"deposit": {"fee_token_addr": "'$USDC'", "token_type": "Native", "transfer_type": "Deposit", "receiver": "'$ID'", "chain_to": "Near", "is_wrapped": false }}' --accountId $ID --gas 300000000000000 --depositYocto 100
```

Remember that `$FEE` and `$USDC` should be replaced with the addresses of the fee and USDC token contracts, respectively. `$ID` should be replaced with the actual ID of the user.

## `ft_transfer_call`

### Interface

```rust
fn ft_transfer_call(
  &mut self,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  amount: U128,
  memo: Option<String>,
  msg: String,
)
```

### Parameters

- `receiver_id` the valid account receiving the token in the destination network
- `amount` amount of tokens being transferred
- `memo` can be used for indexing or providing information for a transfer
- `msg` string with JSON formatted `DepositLog` information

### Example

```shell
# pay the USDC fee to the feer contract
near call $USDC ft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$FEE'", "amount": "1", "msg": "{\"fee_token_addr\":\"'$USDC'\",\"token_addr\": \"'$USDC'\",\"token_type\":\"FT\",\"transfer_type\":\"Fee\",\"receiver\":\"'$ID'\",\"chain_to\":\"Near\",\"is_wrapped\":false}"}' --accountId $ID --gas 300000000000000 --depositYocto 1

# deposit the USDC fee to the feer contract (change amount according to required deposit)
near call $USDC ft_transfer_call '{"receiver_id": "'$FEE'", "amount": "100", "msg": "{\"fee_token_addr\":\"'$USDC'\",\"token_addr\": \"'$USDC'\",\"token_type\":\"FT\",\"transfer_type\":\"Deposit\",\"receiver\":\"'$ID'\",\"chain_to\":\"Near\",\"is_wrapped\":false}"}' --accountId $ID --gas 300000000000000 --depositYocto 1
```

Remember to replace `$USDC` with the address of the USDC token contract.

## `nft_transfer_call`

### Interface

```rust
fn nft_transfer_call(
  &mut self,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  token_id: TokenId,
  approval_id: Option<u64>,
  memo: Option<String>,
  msg: String,
)
```

### Parameters

- `receiver_id` the valid account receiving the token in the destination network
- `token_id` id of the token being sent
- `approval_id` is an optional expected approval ID. A number smaller than `2^53`, and therefore representable as JSON.
- `memo` can be used for indexing or providing information for a transfer
- `msg` string with JSON formatted `DepositLog` information

## `native_withdraw`

### Interface

```rust
pub fn native_withdraw(
  &mut self,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  amount: String,
  origin: String,
  path: Vec<Hash>,
  signature: String,
  recovery_id: RecoveryID,
)
```

### Parameters

- `receiver_id` the valid account receiving the token
- `amount` amount of tokens being transferred
- `origin` operation index
- `path` Merkle tree proof of operation existence in Operations tree
- `signature` TSS signature on Operations tree root
- `recovery_id` value that is used to recover the signer public key

## `ft_withdraw`

### Interface

```rust
pub fn ft_withdraw(
  &mut self,
  token: AccountId,
  amount: U128,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  is_wrapped: bool,
  origin: String,
  path: Vec<Hash>,
  signature: String,
  recovery_id: RecoveryID,
)
```

### Parameters

- `token` address of the token being sent
- `amount` amount of tokens being transferred
- `receiver_id` the valid account receiving the token
- `is_wrapped` boolean value, which shows whether the bridge wraps the token
- `origin` operation index
- `path` Merkle tree proof of operation existence in Operations tree
- `signature` TSS signature on Operations tree root
- `recovery_id` value that is used to recover the signer public key

## `nft_withdraw`

### Interface

```rust
pub fn nft_withdraw(
  &mut self,
  token: AccountId,
  token_id: TokenId,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  token_metadata: Option<NftMetadata>,
  is_wrapped: bool,
  origin: String,
  path: Vec<Hash>,
  signature: String,
  recovery_id: RecoveryID,
)
```

### Parameters

- `token` address of the token being sent
- `token_id` unique id of the token
- `receiver_id` the valid account receiving the token
- `token_metadata` metadata of the transferred token
- `is_wrapped` boolean value, which shows whether the bridge wraps the token
- `origin` operation index
- `path` Merkle tree proof of operation existence in Operations tree
