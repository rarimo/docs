# Bridging Protocol JS-SDK reference

Rarimo's JavaScript SDK provides tools to interact with browser-based wallets and send transactions from wallets to Rarimo's contracts.

For complete reference information about the SDK packages, see the <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/index.html">SDK reference</OutLink>.

## Packages

The Rarimo SDK includes several packages that provide resources for other packages.
In most cases, you do not need to access these packages directly unless you need certain constants, such as the names and types of chains that Rarimo supports.

## @rarimo/shared

The <OutLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/shared">@rarimo/shared</OutLink> package contains constants and utility functions that other packages use.
For example, this code prints names and types of chains that you can refer to in your code:

```ts
const { ChainNames, ChainTypes } = require('@rarimo/shared')

console.log(JSON.stringify(ChainNames, null, 2))
console.log(JSON.stringify(ChainTypes, null, 2))
```

## @rarimo/swap

The <OutLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/swap">@rarimo/swap</OutLink> package provides base functionality that other packages use to swap tokens.

## @rarimo/bridge

The <OutLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/bridge">@rarimo/bridge</OutLink> package provides base functionality that other packages use to bridge tokens.
