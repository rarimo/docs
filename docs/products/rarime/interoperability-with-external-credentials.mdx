# Interoperability with external credentials

[RariMe snap](https://rarime.com/) is a self-sovereign wallet that lives in your MetaMask.
It allows users to store, manage, and disclose credentials in a privacy-preserving way.
In addition to working with Rarimo credentials, the snap can be modified to support your existing verifiable credentials.

<!-- Put MetaMask snap --->

**Key features:**

- Supports W3C DID Verifiable Credentials
- Familiar web3 UX thanks to the MetaMask integration
- 70.000+ snap downloads and active discord community
- Integrated with your MetaMask account, no additional passwords or private keys are needed
- RariMe App for managing credentials and more
- Selective disclosure of private data using zero-knowledge proofs for Rarimo Identity Protocol credentials

## Integration

Support of external credentials is a work in progress, so we’re flexible on the integration options.

### Issuer side

We offer two ways of adding credentials to RariMe:

- by calling the RariMe snap API via a js library in the issuer's web app
- by scanning a QR code with a credential in RariMe App and importing it

### Verifier side

Options for verification depend on the type of signatures used in your credentials.

![Levels of credentials interoperability](/img/rarime-levels-of-credentials-interoperability.png)

For Polygon ID compatible credentials with *BabyJubJub* signature, limited support for zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented.
These ZKPs can be verified both on-chain and off-chain using the iden3 libraries.

For verifiable credentials with *ECDSA* and other types of signature, we can offer the following:

- sharing raw credentials (off-chain usage only, not recommended)
- Merkle proofs for disclosing specific fields of the credential (off-chain, limited usage on-chain)
