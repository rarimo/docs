# RariMe interoperability with external credentials

RariMe is open to interoperability with non-Rarimo credentials. Identity providers may enjoy such benefits as:

- Familiar web3 UX thanks to the MetaMask integration
- <OutLink href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=%40rarimo%2Frarime">150,000+ snap downloads</OutLink> and active discord community
- RariMe App for managing credentials and more
- Selective disclosure

## Integration

:::info
Support of external credentials is a work in progress. Reach out to us in <OutLink href="https://discord.gg/cfrH3Fe7ke">Discord</OutLink> to discuss the integration options.

### Issuer side

We offer two ways of adding credentials to RariMe:

- By calling the RariMe snap API via a js library in the issuer's web app
- By scanning a QR code with a credential in RariMe App and importing it

### Verifier side

Options for verification depend on the type of signatures used in your credentials.

Limited support for zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented for Polygon ID-compatible credentials with the *BabyJubJub* signature.
These ZKPs can be verified both on-chain and off-chain using the iden3 libraries.

For verifiable credentials with *ECDSA* and other types of signature, we can offer the following:
- Sharing raw credentials (off-chain usage only, not recommended)
- Merkle proofs for disclosing specific fields of the credential (off-chain, limited usage on-chain)
