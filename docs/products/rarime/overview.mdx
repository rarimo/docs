# RariMe Identity Wallet

RariMe is a self-sovereign wallet that lives in your MetaMask. It allows users to store, manage, and disclose credentials in a privacy-preserving way.

Key features:
- Supports W3C DID Verifiable Credentials
- Familiar Web3 UX in your web browser
- Integrated with your MetaMask account, no additional passwords or private keys are needed
- Secure, selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proofs
