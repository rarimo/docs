# Rarimo core

Based on Tendermint + Cosmos SDK blockchain core the main goal is to provide validated information about different cross-chain operations.

Rarimo business logic is split into two modules: `x/rarimocore` and `x/tokenmanager`.

The `rarimocore` cosmos module contains logic for all cross-chain operations, its votes, confirmations and signers management.

The common flow consists of three steps:

1. Any Oracle creates the operation on the core
2. Oracles vote for the operation correctness, and after that operation defined as approved/not approved.
3. Signature producers sign the operation
4. Signature producers submit confirmation to the core, and after that operation defined as signed.

See <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/rarimo-core">rarimo-core</OutLink> repository for more details.
