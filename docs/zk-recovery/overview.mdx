# ZK Recovery

Rarimo's ZK Recovery enables you to restore your crypto accounts securely without depending on centralized services. Utilizing the Bionetta ZKML framework, it leverages image recognition for recovery. You can use your face, a physical object (like a book cover), or even your cat as a unique recovery key. This means no more worries about losing your seed phrase, while staying true to the principle of "not your keys, not your coins."

## How it works

The solution is based on account abstraction and implements the <OutLink href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-xxxx-universal-account-recovery-standard-uars/24080">Universal Account Recovery Standard (UARS)</OutLink>.

To set up ZK Recovery, we need to to:
1. Scan the physical object(e.g. a book cover) or your face using a mobile app.
2. Using a locally run ZKML model, extract a vector of features from the scanned object. This vector is a unique representation of the object, which we will call *S*.
3. Save the *S* vector securely, ensuring that it can only be accessed by you(e.g. in a cloud storage with e2e encryption).
4. Calculate a Poseidon hash of the *S* vector and store it in a smart contract wallet.

Importantly, no raw image data is stored on-chain, and the *S* vector is never shared with anyone.

When you need to recover your wallet, the following steps are needed:
1. You can scan the same object or face again.
2. The new scan of the object, original feature vector *S* and hash(*S*) are provided as inputs to a Bionetta ZKML circuit. The circuit will:
   - Calculate the *S'* vector from the new scan.
   - Check similarity between the *S* and *S'* vectors using a distance metric:
        ```
        dist(S, S') < threshold
        ```
    - Prove that *S* is the real pre-image of hash(*S*).
3. Submit the ZK proof to the smart contract wallet, which will verify the proof and unlock the account.

## Challenges & limitations


- It's necessary to store the original feature vector *S* securely. Alternative solutions, such as fuzzy extractors are considered to get rid of this requirement.
- Face scanning on mobile devices will be less accurate than built-in Face ID or similar solutions, due to hardware limitations.
- On its own, ZK Recovery may be not robust enough, making it more suitable for a multi-factor authentication setup. For example, you can combine ZK Recovery with a hardware wallet or a social recovery mechanism.

## Can I use it now?

ZK Recovery is not production grade yet. However, you can contact us on <OutLink href="https://t.me/+pWugh5xgDiE3Y2Jk">Telegram</OutLink> to discuss your use case and get early access to the solution.

## Conclusion

ZK Recovery offers a novel approach to account recovery by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and image recognition. By allowing users to utilize unique physical objects or their own faces as recovery keys, it enhances security while minimizing reliance on traditional recovery methods.
