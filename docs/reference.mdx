## Architecture Overview

<!-- TODO: Add architecture diagram -->

The Rarimo protocol architecture includes the following parts:

- Rarimo Core (Blockchain core that stores validated state)
- TSS service (Threshold signature producers that signs validated operations to provide proof for unlocking on the destination chain)
- Vault (Stores the TSS service keys)
- Saver services or Oracles (The oracles that observers the connected chains state, submits new events and vote for new events' correctness)
- Broadcaster service (Running to broadcast transactions from different services by certain account)
- Smart-contracts (Bridges)
- BDJuno, Hasura and Explorer frontend
- Horizon (Service that communicates with core and provides REST API for frontend integration)
- Relayer service and contracts (Provides user with opportunity to pay for automatic transaction execution)
