# Guide: Use ZK Passport to verify citizenship off-chain

Before getting started with implementing the citizenship check, let’s quickly review all the steps of the process on the diagram below.

<IdealImage img={require('/img/zk-passport-proof-of-citizenship-flow.png')} alt="ZK Passport user flow" />

Basically, it goes likes this:

1. User installs the RariMe App and scans the passport
2. Scan a QR-code in the DApp
3. Gets prompted to generate a proof of eligibility in RariMe App
4. The app submits the proof to the callback URL(specified in the QR code) for verification
5. DApp backend fetches the verification status and citizenship data from a REST API

QR code generation and all the interactions with the backend are facilitated by Rarimo's ZK Passport library, which is available as an NPM package: `@rarimo/zk-passport`. The library provides a convenient API for generating QR codes and verifying the proof status.

You can check out this flow in the sandbox: <OutLink href="https://app.rarime.com/proof-requests-demo">ZK Passport Demo</OutLink>

## Pre-requisites

:::tip
You can use this public instance of `verificator-svc` for testing: <OutLink href="https://api.app.rarime.com/">https://api.app.rarime.com/</OutLink>
:::

To get started, you SHOULD deploy your own instance of https://github.com/rarimo/verificator-svc. This service encapsulates proof verification and provides a convenient REST API for requesting parameters for the QR code, checking the user verification status, etc. You need to trust the instance of `verificator-svc` so the best option is to host your own instance.

## Step #1: Ask the user to install RariMe App and scan the passport

<IdealImage img={require('/img/install-rarime.png')} alt="Install RariMe App" />

Links for installation:

- <OutLink href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rarime/id6503300598">RariMe for iOS | AppStore</OutLink>
- <OutLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarilabs.rarime">RariMe for Android | Google Play</OutLink>

## Step #2: Install `@rarimo/zk-passport-react` package

To install the package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/zk-passport-react
```

If you don't use React, you can use the `@rarimo/zk-passport` package instead. It provides a low-level API for for requesting and passing for verification of ZK Passport proofs.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/zk-passport
```

## Step #3: Import the library and render the QR code

The following JS snippet uses the library to render a QR code with a proof of citizenship request and handles the results:

```jsx
import ZkPassportQrCode from '@rarimo/zk-passport-react'

// this is a public instance of verificator-svc(https://github.com/rarimo/verificator-svc). Replace it with the URL of your instance
const apiUrl = 'https://api.app.rarime.com'

// `requestid` is a public unique ID associated with a user within your system. It will be used in the Step #3 to check the user status
const requestId = 'account-1'

// `event_id` is an arbitrary number that denotes the application scope of the proof, should be something like `APP_ID:ACTION_ID`
const eventId = 1337

const verificationOpts: RequestVerificationLinkOpts = {
  uniqueness: true, // don't allow to submit a single passport multiple times
  nationalityCheck: true, // include user's citizenship in the output(proof public signals)
  eventId: eventId, // scope of the proof
}

return (
  <ZkPassportQrCode
    // Proof request params
    apiUrl={apiUrl}
    requestId={requestId}
    verificationOptions={verificationOpts}

    // QR code component props
    qrProps={{ size: 256 }}

    // place your callbacks here
    onStatusChange={status => console.log(status)}
    onSuccess={proof => console.log(proof)}
    onError={error => console.error(error)}
  />
)
```

## Step #3: Fetch the verification status and the citizenship code on the backend

You can fetch the verification status for a particular `id` from this verificator endpoint:
<OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getUserStatus">https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getUserStatus</OutLink>

Here is a JS snippet for doing this

```ts
const backendUrl = 'https://api.app.rarime.com/'
const userId = 'some-user-id' // the `id` from step #2

const response = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/integrations/verificator-svc/private/verification-status/${userId}`)
const { data } = await response.json()

// responseUserId === userId
const responseUserId = data.id

// Verification status enum:
// - "not_verified" - user is not verified
// - "verified" - user is verified
// - "failed_verification" - user verification failed
// - "uniqueness_check_failed" - user uniqueness check failed
const verificationStatus = data.attributes.status
```

If the user has status `verified`, you can fetch the verified citizenship code like this:

```ts
const response = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/integrations/verificator-svc/private/user/${userId}`)
const { data } = await response.json()

// ISO 3166 alpha-3 country code: https://www.iban.com/country-codes
// Note: German passports may have a single-letter "D" code
const citizenshipISOCode = data.attributes.nationality // e.g. "UKR"
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up off-chain citizenship verification using ZK Passport and the RariMe App, enabling secure proof of citizenship without exposing private user data.
