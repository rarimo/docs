# Guide: Using ZK Passport for off-chain verification

Before getting started with implementing off-chain verification, let's quickly review all the steps of the process on the diagram below.

<IdealImage img={require('/img/zk-passport-proof-of-citizenship-flow.png')} alt="ZK Passport user flow" />

The basic verification flow works like this:

1. User installs the RariMe App and scans their identity document
2. User scans a QR-code in your DApp
3. User gets prompted to generate a proof of the requested attribute in RariMe App
4. The app submits the proof to the callback URL (specified in the QR code) for verification
5. Your DApp backend fetches the verification status and verified data from a REST API

QR code generation and all the interactions with the backend are facilitated by Rarimo's ZK Passport library, which is available as an NPM package: `@rarimo/zk-passport`. The library provides a convenient API for generating QR codes and verifying the proof status.

You can check out this flow in the sandbox: <OutLink href="https://app.rarime.com/proof-requests-demo">ZK Passport Demo</OutLink>

## Pre-requisites

:::tip
You can use this public instance of `verificator-svc` for testing: <OutLink href="https://api.app.rarime.com/">https://api.app.rarime.com/</OutLink>
:::

To get started, you SHOULD deploy your own instance of <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/verificator-svc">verificator-svc</OutLink>. This service encapsulates proof verification and provides a convenient REST API for requesting parameters for the QR code, checking the user verification status, etc. You need to trust the instance of `verificator-svc` so the best option is to host your own instance.

API docs: <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/">verificator-svc | ReDoc</OutLink>

## Step #1: Ask the user to install RariMe App and scan their identity document

<IdealImage img={require('/img/install-rarime.png')} alt="Install RariMe App" />

Links for installation:

- <OutLink href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rarime/id6503300598">RariMe for iOS | AppStore</OutLink>
- <OutLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarilabs.rarime">RariMe for Android | Google Play</OutLink>

## Step #2: Install `@rarimo/zk-passport-react` package

To install the package, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/zk-passport-react
```

If you don't use React, you can use the `@rarimo/zk-passport` package instead. It provides a low-level API for requesting and verification of ZK Passport proofs.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/zk-passport
```

## Step #3: Import the library and render the QR code

The following JS snippet uses the library to render a QR code with a verification request and handles the results:

```jsx
import ZkPassportQrCode from '@rarimo/zk-passport-react'

// this is a public instance of verificator-svc(https://github.com/rarimo/verificator-svc). Replace it with the URL of your instance
const apiUrl = 'https://api.app.rarime.com'

// `requestid` is a public unique ID associated with a user within your system. It will be used later to check the user status
const requestId = 'account-1'

// `event_id` is an arbitrary number that denotes the application scope of the proof
const eventId = 1337

const verificationOpts: RequestVerificationLinkOpts = {
  uniqueness: true, // check if the user has already passed the verification
  nationalityCheck: true, // include user's citizenship in the output(proof public signals)
  // you can include other options based on your verification requirements
  eventId: eventId, // scope of the proof
}

return (
  <ZkPassportQrCode
    // Proof request params
    apiUrl={apiUrl}
    requestId={requestId}
    verificationOptions={verificationOpts}

    // QR code component props
    qrProps={{ size: 256 }}

    // place your callbacks here
    onStatusChange={status => console.log(status)}
    onSuccess={proof => console.log(proof)}
    onError={error => console.error(error)}
  />
)
```

## Step #4: Fetch the verification status and data on the backend

You can fetch the verification status for a particular `id` from this verificator endpoint:
<OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getUserStatus">https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getUserStatus</OutLink>

Here is a JS snippet for checking verification status:

```ts
const backendUrl = 'https://api.app.rarime.com/'
const userId = 'some-user-id' // the `id` from step #3

const response = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/integrations/verificator-svc/private/verification-status/${userId}`)
const { data } = await response.json()

// responseUserId === userId
const responseUserId = data.id

// Verification status enum:
// - "not_verified" - user is not verified
// - "verified" - user is verified
// - "failed_verification" - user verification failed
// - "uniqueness_check_failed" - user uniqueness check failed
const verificationStatus = data.attributes.status
```

If the user has status `verified`, you can fetch the verified attribute data like this:

```ts
const response = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/integrations/verificator-svc/private/user/${userId}`)
const { data } = await response.json()

// Depending on what attributes you requested in your verification options
// For example, if you requested nationalityCheck:
// ISO 3166 alpha-3 country code: https://www.iban.com/country-codes
// Note: German passports may have a single-letter "D" code
const citizenshipISOCode = data.attributes.nationality // e.g. "UKR"

// Other attributes might be available depending on your verification request
```

## Example use cases

Here are some common verification scenarios you can implement:

1. **Citizenship verification**: Verify a user's nationality without seeing their passport
2. **Age verification**: Check if a user is above a certain age without knowing their birth date
3. **Identity uniqueness**: Ensure each physical person can only create one account

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up an off-chain verification system using ZK Passport and the RariMe App, enabling secure proof of user attributes without exposing private data. This approach allows you to create privacy-preserving verification flows for various use cases while maintaining compliance with data protection regulations.
