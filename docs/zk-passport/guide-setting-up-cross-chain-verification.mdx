1. Deployed the **RegistrationSMTReplicator** contract for ZK Registry state replication.
2. Set up your relayer or front-end submission flow.

## Step 1: Deploy the RegistrationSMTReplicator

The **RegistrationSMTReplicator** handles the replication of state from the ZK Registry onto your chain. This ensures your chain is kept up to date with changes to passport registrations.

1. **Obtain the contract code** for `RegistrationSMTReplicator` (contact the provider of the ZK Registry or check their repository for the contract source).

2. **Deploy** the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` to your chain:

   ```solidity
   // Example snippet (pseudo-code)
   RegistrationSMTReplicator replicator = new RegistrationSMTReplicator(
       registryRoot,
       allowedUpdaterAddress
   );
   ```

3. **Configure** your relayer service or front-end to submit state updates to the `RegistrationSMTReplicator`. These updates keep the replicated data on your chain in sync with the ZK Registry.

   - **Option A**: Spin up a **relayer service** to automatically listen for on-chain events from the ZK Registry and relay state updates to your chain.
   - **Option B**: Submit updates **from your front-end**. This requires you to collect state updates (e.g., new leaves in the Merkle tree, updated Merkle roots) from the ZK Registry and call a function like `updateState(...)` on the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract.

   > **Note**: If you want to implement Option B, you can reach out to the ZK Registry team for more detailed instructions on how to collect state updates client-side.
