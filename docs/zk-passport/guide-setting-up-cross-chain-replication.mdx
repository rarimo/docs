# Guide: Setting up cross-chain replication for ZK Passport

:::info
Native state transfer to Ethereum L1 is currently under construction.

This guide walks you through the process of setting up cross-chain replication for ZK Passport Registry state. By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. Deployed the **RegistrationSMTReplicator** contract on the target chain.
1. Set up your relayer or front-end submission flow.

## Step 1: Deploy the RegistrationSMTReplicator

The **RegistrationSMTReplicator** handles the replication of state from the ZK Registry onto your chain. This ensures your chain is kept up to date with changes to passport registrations.

1. **Obtain the contract code** for `RegistrationSMTReplicator` (contact the provider of the ZK Registry or check their repository for the contract source).

1. **Deploy** the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` to your chain:

   ```solidity
   // Example snippet (pseudo-code)
   RegistrationSMTReplicator replicator = new RegistrationSMTReplicator(
       registryRoot,
       allowedUpdaterAddress
   );
   ```

## Step 2: Set up the relayer with front-end submission to replicate the states

To keep the state of the ZK Registry in sync with your chain, you need to set up a relayer with front-end submission.
This will ensure that any changes in the ZK Registry are reflected in the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract.

You have to set up backend service and make your front-end app update the root:
1. **Relayer**: Run a relayer service that listens for events from the ZK Registry.

   - Follow the instructions in <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/proof-verification-relayer">proof-verification-relayer README</OutLink>.
   - Make sure you set the right replicator contract address and private key of corresponding `allowedUpdaterAddress` in the config.
   - Make sure <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/proof-verification-relayer/#tag/State/operation/GetState">endpoint</OutLink> is available for your frontend app.

1. **Front-end**: Send the state update transactions on-demand from your front-end:
   - After obtaining the proof from verificator-svc you know the required `root` (it is a <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-zk-circuits/?tab=readme-ov-file#query-circuit-public-signals">11th pub signal</OutLink>).
   - Now you can get signed state by root
   ```typescript
   export async function getSignedRootState(root: string): Promise<SignedRootStateResponse> {
     const res = await api.get<SignedRootStateResponse>(
       `${ApiServicePaths.ProofVerificationRelayer}/v1/state`,
       { query: { filter: { root } } },
     )
     return res.data
   }```
   - You can use the `updateState(...)` function on the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract to submit state updates.
