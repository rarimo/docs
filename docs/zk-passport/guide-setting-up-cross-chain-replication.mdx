# Guide: Setting up cross-chain replication for ZK Passport

:::info
Native state transfer to Ethereum L1 is currently under construction.
:::

This guide walks you through the process of setting up cross-chain replication for ZK Passport Registry state. By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. Deployed the **RegistrationSMTReplicator** contract on the target chain.
2. Set up your relayer or front-end submission flow.

## Step 1: Deploy the RegistrationSMTReplicator

The **RegistrationSMTReplicator** handles the replication of state from the ZK Registry onto your chain. This ensures your chain is kept up to date with changes to passport registrations.

1. **Obtain the contract code** for <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-contracts/blob/6812b70ca12209ccf1bb3179e1358dbcbe7e9f3e/contracts/sdk/RegistrationSMTReplicator.sol">RegistrationSMTReplicator</OutLink>.

2. **Deploy** the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` to your chain and initialize it:

   ```ts
   await replicator.__RegistrationSMTReplicator_init(
      [oracle],  // list of oracle public keys that can submit roots directly
      sourceSMT  // contract address of the original registry on Rarimo L2
   );
   ```

## Step 2: Set up the relayer with front-end submission to replicate the states

To keep the state of the ZK Registry in sync with your chain, you need to set up a relayer with front-end submission.
This will ensure that any changes in the ZK Registry are reflected in the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract.

You have to set up backend service and make your front-end app update the root:

1. **Relayer**: Run a relayer service that listens for events from the ZK Registry.

   - Follow the instructions in <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/proof-verification-relayer">proof-verification-relayer README</OutLink>.
   - Make sure you set the right replicator contract address and private key of corresponding `allowedUpdaterAddress` in the config.
   - Make sure <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/proof-verification-relayer/#tag/State/operation/GetState">endpoint</OutLink> is available for your frontend app.
   - Make sure that the relayer's corresponding key is set as an oracle in the replicator contract. You can check this using the <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-contracts/blob/6812b70ca12209ccf1bb3179e1358dbcbe7e9f3e/contracts/sdk/RegistrationSMTReplicator.sol#L152">`isOracle(address)`</OutLink> method on the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract.

2. **Front-end**: Send the state update transactions on-demand from your front-end:
   - After obtaining the proof from verificator-svc you know the required `root` (it is a <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-zk-circuits/?tab=readme-ov-file#query-circuit-public-signals">11th pub signal</OutLink>).
   - Now you can get signed state by root
   ```typescript
   async function getSignedRootState(root: string) {
     const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com'

     const requestUrl = new URL(`${API_BASE_URL}/integrations/proof-verification-relayer/v2/state`)
     requestUrl.searchParams.set('filter[root]', root)

     const res = await fetch(requestUrl.toString())
     const { data } = await res.json()

     return {
       // Signature of root state signed by relayer private key.
       signature: data.attributes.signature,
       // Time when the event was caught, a.k.a state transition timestamp
       timestamp: data.attributes.timestamp,
     }
   }
   ```
   - You can use the <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-contracts/blob/6812b70ca12209ccf1bb3179e1358dbcbe7e9f3e/contracts/sdk/RegistrationSMTReplicator.sol#L102">`transitionRootWithSignature(root, timestamp, signature)`</OutLink> method on the `RegistrationSMTReplicator` contract to submit state updates.
