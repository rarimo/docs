# Guide: Setting up on-chain user verification with ZK Passport

This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up on-chain verification of ZK Passport proofs on-chain. By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. Ensure that you have all the necessary components in place to verify ZK Passport proofs on your chain.
1. Deployed the **Verificator** contract on your chain to handle proof verification.
1. Integrated verification logic in your own contract to validate proof public signals.

>TODO: add step for setting up the front-end with our new SDK

## Prerequisites

- In case you are using an EVM-compatible chain other than Rarimo's L2, you'll need to to set up the ZK Passport Registry state replication as described in [Setting up cross-chain verification](/zk-passport/guide-setting-up-cross-chain-replication).
- Access to the [`verificator-svc`](https://github.com/rarimo) service for retrieving proof parameters. You can use the public instance of `verificator-svc` <OutLink href="https://api.app.rarime.com/">https://api.app.rarime.com/</OutLink>  for testing, but it's recommended to deploy your own instance for production use, as described in [Setting up verificator-svc](/zk-passport/guide-setting-up-verificator-svc).

## Step 1: Deploy the Verificator smart contract

>TODO: put this contract into an npm package?
>TODO: guide to customizing the query params

The **Verificator** contract is responsible for verifying the ZK proofs on-chain. This contract often comes with a precompiled ZK circuit.

1. Obtain the `Verificator` contract <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-voting-contracts/blob/4cccd0ca8613330c4af68d8e0f7ca46bd3b68ac9/contracts/voting/verifiers/BioPassportVotingVerifier.sol">source code</OutLink> and add it to your project.

   ```solidity
   contract Verificator {
        function verifyProof(
            uint[2] calldata _pA,
            uint[2][2] calldata _pB,
            uint[2] calldata _pC,
            uint[23] calldata _pubSignals
        ) public view returns (bool) {
            ...
        }
   }
   ```
1. Deploy it to your chain and record the address of the newly deployed `Verificator`. You will use this address in your other contracts to verify proofs.

## Step 2: Integrate Proof Verification in Your Smart Contract

Once your chain is replicating ZK Registry state and you have a deployed `Verificator` contract, you can add ZK proof checks to your own contract logic.

### A. Collect public signals and proof from `verificator-svc`

When a user scans a QR code and submits a proof:

1. Your DApp calls the <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getProof">`getProof`</OutLink> endpoint from `verificator-svc`.
1. Receive both `pubSignals` and the `proof` from the service:

   ```json
   {
     "pubSignals": ["12345", "67890", "..."],
     "proof": "0xabc123..."
   }
   ```

1. Pass the `pubSignals` as calldata to the `verifyProof()` method in the smart contract along the `proof`.

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    interface IVerificator {
        function verifyProof(
            uint256[] calldata pubSignals,
            bytes calldata proof
        ) external view returns (bool);
    }

    contract MyPassportContract {
        IVerificator public verificator;

        constructor(address _verificator) {
            // this is the address of the deployed Verificator contract from step #1
            verificator = IVerificator(_verificator);
        }

        function verifyPassportProof(
            uint256[] calldata pubSignals,
            bytes calldata proof
        ) external {
            // highlight-start
            bool isValid = verificator.verifyProof(pubSignals, proof);
            require(isValid, "Passport proof is invalid!");
            // highlight-end

            // If the proof is valid, proceed with your logic
            // e.g., granting access, minting an NFT, etc.
        }
    }
    ```

    The critical part is:

    ```solidity
    bool isValid = verificator.verifyProof(pubSignals, proof);
    require(isValid, "Passport proof is invalid!");
    ```

    Here, your contract delegates ZK proof validation to the deployed `Verificator` contract.

### B. Manually assemble the pub signals before passing them to the `verifyProof` method

In your smart contract (let's call it `MyPassportContract`), you would do something like this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {VerifierHelper} from "@solarity/solidity-lib/libs/zkp/snarkjs/VerifierHelper.sol";


interface IVerificator {
    function verifyProof(
        uint256[] calldata pubSignals,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external view returns (bool);
}

contract MyPassportContract {
    IVerificator public verificator;

    constructor(address _verificator) {
        // this is the address of the deployed Verificator contract from step #1
        verificator = IVerificator(_verificator);
    }

    function verifyPassportProof(
        bytes32 registrationRoot_,
        uint256 currentDate_,
        uint256 eventId_,
        uint256[] memory eventData_,
        UserData memory userData_,
        VerifierHelper.ProofPoints memory zkPoints_
    ) external {
        // highlight-start
        uint256[] memory pubSignals_ = new uint256[](PROOF_SIGNALS_COUNT);

        pubSignals_[0] = userData_.nullifier; // output, nullifier
        pubSignals_[4] = userData_.citizenship;
        pubSignals_[9] = proposalEventId; // input, eventId used to scope your proofs
        pubSignals_[10] = uint248(uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(eventData_)))); // input, eventData specific to your DApp
        pubSignals_[11] = uint256(registrationRoot_); // input, ZK Registry state root at the moment of proving
        pubSignals_[12] = SELECTOR; // input, selector specifying the passport fields to be revealed
        pubSignals_[13] = currentDate_; // input, currentDate
        pubSignals_[15] = identityCreationTimestampUpperBound; // input, timestampUpperbound
        pubSignals_[17] = identityCounterUpperBound; // input
        pubSignals_[18] = ZERO_DATE; // input, birthDateLowerbound
        pubSignals_[19] = proposalRules_.birthDateUpperbound; // input, birthDateUpperbound
        pubSignals_[20] = proposalRules_.expirationDateLowerBound; // input, expirationDateLowerbound
        pubSignals_[21] = ZERO_DATE; // input, expirationDateUpperbound

        require(votingVerifier.verifyProof(pubSignals_, zkPoints_), "Passport proof is invalid!");
        // highlight-end

        // If the proof is valid, proceed with your logic
        // e.g., granting access, minting an NFT, etc.
    }
}
```

Here are a couple of code references that demonstrate how to collect proof public signals and pass them to a verification contract:

- **<OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/eip1155-eth/blob/main/contracts/ERC1155ETH.sol#L155">ERC1155ETH.sol</OutLink>**
  Shows how a contract gathers public signals and proof parameters before calling `verifyProof`.

- **<OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-voting-contracts/blob/master/contracts/voting/BioPassportVoting.sol#L65">BioPassportVoting.sol</OutLink>**
  Demonstrates a voting contract that uses ZK proofs for passport-based identity checks.


## Conclusion

With these steps:

1. **Replicate** the ZK Registry state using `RegistrationSMTReplicator`.
2. **Get** proof parameters from `verificator-svc` to collect the ZK Proof in our DApp.
3. **Deploy** your `Verificator` contract to verify the proofs.
4. **Integrate** `verifyProof(...)` calls in your own contract logic.

We've set up on-chain verification of ZK Passport proofs. This allows you to verify user identities without revealing sensitive data, ensuring privacy and security in your application.
