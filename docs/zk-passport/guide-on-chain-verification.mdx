# Guide: Setting up on-chain user verification with ZK Passport

This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up on-chain verification of ZK Passport proofs. By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

1. Ensured that you have all the necessary components in place to verify ZK Passport proofs on your chain.
2. Deployed the `TD3QueryProofVerifier` contract on your chain to handle proof verification.
3. Integrated verification logic into your own contract to validate proof public signals.

//TODO:
// - add step for setting up the front-end with our new SDK
// - guide to customizing the query params
}

## Prerequisites

- If you are using an EVM-compatible chain other than Rarimo's L2, you'll need to set up ZK Passport Registry state replication as described in [Setting up Cross-Chain Verification](/zk-passport/guide-setting-up-cross-chain-replication).
- Access to the <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/verificator-svc">`verificator-svc`</OutLink> service for retrieving proof parameters. You can use the public instance of `verificator-svc` (<OutLink href="https://api.app.rarime.com/">https://api.app.rarime.com/</OutLink>) for testing, but it's recommended to deploy your own instance for production use, as described in [Setting up `verificator-svc`](/zk-passport/guide-setting-up-verificator-svc).

## Step 1: Add the Rarimo Passport Contracts library to your project

The contracts are available in the <OutLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/passport-contracts">@rarimo/passport-contracts</OutLink> npm package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/passport-contracts
```

## Step 2: Deploy the TD3QueryProofVerifier smart contract


The `TD3QueryProofVerifier ` contract is responsible for verifying ZK proofs on-chain. This contract often comes with a precompiled ZK circuit.

Import the `TD3QueryProofVerifier ` contract from the Rarimo Passport Contracts library:

```solidity
import {TD3QueryProofVerifier } from "@rarimo/passport-contracts/sdk/verifier/TD3QueryProofVerifier.sol";
```

Then deploy it to your chain and record the address of the newly deployed `TD3QueryProofVerifier `. You will use this address in your other contracts to verify proofs.

## Step 3: Integrate proof verification into your smart contract

Once your chain is replicating ZK Registry state and you have a deployed `TD3QueryProofVerifier ` contract, you can add ZK proof checks to your own contract logic.

Below is a skeleton of the DApp that relies on the Query Proof Verification to perform some actions (token mint, grant a role, etc.).

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {IPoseidonSMT} from "@rarimo/passport-contracts/interfaces/state/IPoseidonSMT.sol";
import {AQueryProofExecutor} from "@rarimo/passport-contracts/sdk/AQueryProofExecutor.sol";
import {PublicSignalsBuilder} from "@rarimo/passport-contracts/sdk/lib/PublicSignalsBuilder.sol";

contract MyPassportContract is AQueryProofExecutor {
    struct UserData {
        uint256 nullifier;
        uint256 identityCreationTimestamp;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => bool) public usedNullifiers;

    constructor(address registrationSMT_, address verifier_) {
        __AQueryProofExecutor_init(registrationSMT_, verifier_);
    }

    // Called before proof verification
    function _beforeVerify(bytes32, uint256, bytes memory userPayload_) public override {
        (address user, UserData memory userData) = abi.decode(
            userPayload_,
            (address, UserData)
        );

        require(!usedNullifiers[userData.nullifier], "Nullifier already used");
        usedNullifiers[userData.nullifier] = true;
    }

    // Called after successful proof verification
    function _afterVerify(bytes32, uint256, bytes memory userPayload_) public override {
        (address user, UserData memory userData) = abi.decode(
            userPayload_,
            (address, UserData)
        );

        // Grant access, mint tokens, or perform other actions
        // Example: grantAccess(user);
    }

     // Builds the public signals for verification
    function _buildPublicSignals(
        bytes32,
        uint256 currentDate_,
        bytes memory userPayload_
    ) public override returns (uint256 dataPointer_) {
        (address user, UserData memory userData) = abi.decode(
            userPayload_,
            (address, UserData)
        );

        // Query proof verification logic here

        return dataPointer_;
    }
}
```

The critical parts are the three required override methods:

```solidity
  // Called before proof verification
  function _beforeVerify(bytes32 registrationRoot_, uint256 currentDate_, bytes memory userPayload_) public override { /* ... */ }

  // Called after successful proof verification
  function _afterVerify(bytes32 registrationRoot_, uint256 currentDate_, bytes memory userPayload_) public override { /* ... */ }

  // Builds the public signals for verification
  function _buildPublicSignals(bytes32 registrationRoot_, uint256 currentDate_, bytes memory userPayload_)
        public override returns (uint256 dataPointer_) { /* ... */ }
```

Above, your contract inherits from `AQueryProofExecutor`, which handles the ZK proof validation internally.

Below, you can see detailed structure for the `_buildPublicSignals` function. Which is the core of the SDK, where you setup the constraints for identity verification.

```solidity
function _buildPublicSignals(
    bytes32,
    uint256 currentDate_,
    bytes memory userPayload_
) public override returns (uint256 dataPointer_) {
    (address user, UserData memory userData) = abi.decode(
        userPayload_,
        (address, UserData)
    );

    // highlight-start
    uint256 identityCreationTimestampUpperBound = getIdentityCreationTimestampUpperBound();
    uint256 identityCounterUpperBound = type(uint32).max;

    if (userData.identityCreationTimestamp > 0) {
        identityCreationTimestampUpperBound = userData.identityCreationTimestamp;
        identityCounterUpperBound = 1;
    }

    dataPointer_ = PublicSignalsBuilder.newPublicSignalsBuilder(SELECTOR, userData.nullifier);
    dataPointer_.withEventIdAndData(getEventId(user), getEventData());
    dataPointer_.withCurrentDate(currentDate_, 1 days);
    dataPointer_.withTimestampLowerboundAndUpperbound(0, identityCreationTimestampUpperBound);
    dataPointer_.withBirthDateLowerboundAndUpperbound(
        PublicSignalsBuilder.ZERO_DATE,
        BIRTHDAY_UPPERBOUND
    );
    dataPointer_.withIdentityCounterLowerbound(0, identityCounterUpperBound);
    dataPointer_.withExpirationDateLowerboundAndUpperbound(
        currentDate_,
        PublicSignalsBuilder.ZERO_DATE
    );
    // highlight-end

    return dataPointer_;
}

// Helper functions
function getIdentityCreationTimestampUpperBound() public view returns (uint256) {
    return accessStartTimestamp - IPoseidonSMT(getRegistrationSMT()).ROOT_VALIDITY();
}

function getEventId(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    // Implementation depends on your application
    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.chainid, address(this), user)));
}

function getEventData() public view returns (uint256) {
    // Implementation depends on your application
    return uint256(uint248(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(/* some data*/)))));
}
```

The client application calls the `function execute(registrationRoot, currentDate, userPayload, zkPoints_)` to perform the actions and verify the Query Proof.

### References

Here are a couple of code references that demonstrate how to collect proof public signals and pass them to a verification contract:

- **<OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/erc20-query-proof-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ClaimableToken.sol">ClaimableToken.sol</OutLink>**
  Simplest example with the uniqueness and age checks

- **<OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/passport-voting-contracts/blob/master/contracts/voting/BioPassportVoting.sol">BioPassportVoting.sol</OutLink>**
  Demonstrates a voting contract that uses ZK proofs for passport-based identity checks.

### Collect public signals and proof from `verificator-svc` and send it to the contract

When a user scans a QR code and submits a proof:

1. Your DApp calls the <OutLink href="https://rarimo.github.io/verificator-svc/#tag/User-verification/operation/getProof">`getProof`</OutLink> endpoint from `verificator-svc`.
2. Receive both `pubSignals` and the `proof` from the service:

```json
{
  "pubSignals": ["12345", "67890", "..."],
  "proof": {
    "pi_a": ["0x123...", "0x456..."],
    "pi_b": [["0x789...", "0xabc..."], ["0xdef...", "0x123..."]],
    "pi_c": ["0x456...", "0x789..."]
  }
}
   ```

3. Call the `execute` method with following parameters: `registrationRoot`, `currentDate`, `userPayload` and `proof`.

## Conclusion

With these steps:

1. **Set up** the ZK Passport Registry state replication on your chain if needed.
1. **Deploy** the `TD3QueryProofVerifier` contract to facilitate ZK proof verification.
1. **Get** proof parameters from `verificator-svc` to collect the ZK Proof in your DApp.
1. **Deploy** your `MyPassportContract` contract to verify proofs and do specific tasks.
1. **Call** the `execute` method on the `MyPassportContract` contract to perform some action alongside Query Proof Verification

We've set up on-chain verification of ZK Passport proofs. This allows you to verify user identities without revealing sensitive data, ensuring privacy and security in your application.
