# Guide: Becoming a Rarimo validator

The following guide will instruct you on setting up the Rarimo node and stake the tokens to become the validator.
We will also set up a broadcaster service, TSS service, and EVM identity saver service.

## Node (rarimo-core)

To run the node, follow these steps:

1. Download the following:
  - <OutLink href="https://storage.cloud.google.com/rarimo-mainnet/core/genesis.json">genesis file</OutLink>
  - <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/core/addrbook.json">address book</OutLink>,
  - <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/core/app.toml">APP file</OutLink>
  - <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/core/rarimo-core">rarimo core binary file</OutLink>

1. Generate validator configs using `rarimo-core` binary

1. Connect to `34.66.205.183`.
   This IP address is used for submitting TXs and p2p connections.

1. Connect to the RPC node: `39072210913bb52a6444543ad160b04668d58210@34.66.205.183:26656`

1. Execute script to set environments:

```bash
export MONIKER_NAME=YOU_VALIDATOR_NAME
export RARIMO_HOME=YOU_RARIMO_HOME_PATH
export RARIMO_NODE=tcp://34.66.205.183:26657
```

1. This script will init folder structure:

```bash
rarimo-core init $MONIKER_NAME --chain-id=rarimo_201411-1 --home=$RARIMO_HOME
```

1. Paste `genesis.json` and `app.toml` (downloaded before) in `$RARIMO_HOME/config/` folder.

1. Create validator's private key:

```bash
rarimo-core keys add <key-name> --keyring-backend test --home=$RARIMO_HOME
```

Remember to save your mnemonic and address.

1. Use your mnemonic to get ECDSA private key:

```bash
rarimo-core tx rarimocore parse-mnemonic 'mnemonic phrase'
```

1. Add environment var with created address:

```bash
export LOCAL_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=rarimo...
```

1. Backup the following files and folders:

```bash
$RARIMO_HOME/config/priv_validator_key.json
$RARIMO_HOME/config/node_key.json
$RARIMO_HOME/keyring-test
```

1. Check validator seed:

```bash
rarimo-core tendermint show-node-id --home=$RARIMO_HOME
```

1. Check that the key exists in the keystore:

```bash
rarimo-core keys show $LOCAL_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS --keyring-backend test --home=$RARIMO_HOME
```

1. To run, use environment variables:

```yaml
- name: DAEMON_NAME
  value: 'rarimo-core'

- name: DAEMON_HOME
  value: $RARIMO_HOME

- name: DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES
  value: 'true'
```

1. Use the following command to start your node:

```bash
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin && cp YOU_STORE_CORE_BIN(name rarimo-core) $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/genesis/bin && cosmovisor run start --home=$RARIMO_HOME --rpc.laddr tcp://0.0.0.0:26657
```

That address will be used for your validator staking and your oracles.

## Broadcaster service (broadcaster-svc)

To set up the broadcaster service, you will need your previously generated private key (you can get it via mnemonic).

Follow these steps:

1. Download the <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/modules/broadcaster-svc">broadcaster server binary</OutLink>

The following configuration `config.yaml` file should be provided to launch your broadcaster service (paste your private key in hex format):

```yaml
log:
  disable_sentry: true
  level: debug

## Port to listen incoming requests
listener:
  addr: :80

## PostgreSQL database connect
db:
  url: 'postgres://broadcaster:broadcaster@broadcaster-db/broadcaster?sslmode=disable'

key:
  ## Rarimo account private key in Hex format: 0x123fab...
  sender_prv_hex: ''
  ## Rarimo chain id
  chain_id: 'rarimo_201411-1'
  ## Base coin name
  coin_name: 'urmo'

cosmos:
  addr: 'validator:9090'
```

1. You will also need some environment variables to run the service:

```yaml
name: KV_VIPER_FILE
value: /config/config.yaml # The path to your config file
```

1. Finally, perform migrations and start the service:

```bash
broadcaster-svc migrate up && broadcaster-svc run all
```

## EVM identity saver

Currently, it should be one instance per account only for Polygon.

To set up EVM identity saver service, follow these steps:

1. Download <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/1.0.4/evm-identity-saver-svc">EVM Identity Saver service binary</OutLink>

1. The following configuration `config.yaml` file should be provided to launch your oracle:

```yaml
log:
  disable_sentry: true
  level: debug

## Port to listen incoming requests (used to trigger revote for some operation - rare flow)
listener:
  addr: :8000

evm:
  ## State contract for listening
  contract_addr: '0x624ce98D2d27b20b8f8d521723Df8fC4db71D79D'
  ## Polygon websocket address
  rpc: ''
  ## Start block to listen events. (0 - listen from current). Used to catchup old events. Be careful to use.
  start_from_block: 0
  ## According to network name in Rarimo core. Example: Polygon
  network_name: Polygon
  ## How many blocks should be created after event to fetch it.
  block_window: 20

broadcaster:
  ## address of broadcaster-svc
  addr: ''
  ## sender account address (rarimo..)
  sender_account: ''

## Rarimo chain connections

core:
  addr: tcp://validator:26657

cosmos:
  addr: validator:9090

## Profiling

profiler:
  enabled: false
  addr: :8080

## Issuer information

state_contract_cfg:
  issuer_id: ['']
  disable_filtration: true
```

1. Add the path to your config file to the environment variables:

```yaml
- name: KV_VIPER_FILE
  value: /config/config.yaml # the path to your config file
```

Oracle service requires the staking of some RMO tokens in the Rarimo chain.

1. To start the service (in vote mode), use the following command:

```bash
evm-identity-saver-svc run state-update-voter
```

## TSS

To become an active TSS party, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download <OutLink href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rarimo-mainnet/1.0.4/tss-svc">TSS service binary</OutLink>

1. Generate TSS account (it is recommended to generate the new one and not use it in other services):

```shell
rarimo-core keys add <key-name> --keyring-backend test --home=$TSS_HOME
```

Also, you need to parse the mnemonic to get the corresponding private key:

```shell
rarimo-core tx rarimocore parse-mnemonic 'mnemonic phrase'
```

1. Pre-setup secret parameters, execute and save response JSON:

```shell
tss-svc run paramgen
```

1. Generate trial ECDSA private key, execute and store results:

```shell
tss-svc run prvgen
```

1. Set up the Vault service and create a secret for your TSS (type KV version 2). The secret should contain the following credentials:

```
  * "data": "Leave empty"

  * "pre": "Generated pre params JSON"

  * "account": "Your Rarimo account hex key"

  * "trial": "Generated Trial ECDSA private key hex"
```

JSON example:

```json
{
  "tls": true,
  "data": "",
  "pre": "pre-generated-secret-data",
  "account": "rarimo-account-private-key-hex-leading-0x",
  "trial": "trial-ecdsa-private-key-hex-leading-0x"
}
```

1. Create a configuration file `config.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
log:
  disable_sentry: true
  level: debug

## PostreSQL connection

db:
  url: 'postgres://tss:tss@tss-2-db:5432/tss?sslmode=disable'

## Port to listen for incoming GRPC requests

listener:
  addr: :9000

## Core connections

core:
  addr: tcp://validator:26657

cosmos:
  addr: validator:9090

## Session configuration (should be the same for all services across the system)

session:
  start_block: 100
  start_session_id: 0

## Swagger doc configuration

swagger:
  addr: :1313
  enabled: false

## Chain configuration

chain:
  chain_id: 'rarimo_201411-1'
  coin_name: 'urmo'
```

1. Set up host environment:

```yaml
  - name: KV_VIPER_FILE
  value: /config/config.yaml # is the path to your config file
  - name: VAULT_PATH
  value: http://vault-internal:8200 # your vault endpoint
  - name: VAULT_TOKEN
  value: "" # your vault token ("root"/"read/write")
  - name: MOUNT_PATH
  value: secret
  - name: SECRET_PATH
  value: tss # name of the secret path vault (type KV version 2)
```

1. To launch the service, use the following command.

```shell
tss-svc migrate up && tss-svc run service
```

Note that your TSS service should be accessible only using a secure TLS connection.

After some period, your TSS will generate new keys together with other active parties and become an active party.

## Finishing with validator

Execute the command to stake tokens and become a validator.
You need to stake exactly 1000000urmo, which is equal to 1 RMO.

```bash
rarimo-core tx staking create-validator
	--amount 1000000urmo \
	--commission-max-change-rate "0.01" \
	--commission-max-rate "0.2" \
	--commission-rate "0.1" \
	--min-self-delegation "1" \
	--details "Meet new Rarimo validator" \
	--pubkey $(rarimo-core tendermint show-validator --home=$RARIMO_HOME) \
	--moniker $MONIKER_NAME \
	--chain-id rarimo_201411-1 \
	--fees 0urmo \
	--from $LOCAL_VALIDATOR_ADDRESS \
	--home=$RARIMO_HOME \
	--node=$RARIMO_NODE \
	--keyring-backend=test \
```

**Congratulations, you are a Rarimo Mainnet validator!**
