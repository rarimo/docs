# Guide: Issuing credentials to RariMe

:::tip
If you still need to learn to issue Rarimo credentials, see [Setting Up A Credentials Issuer](/credential-trees/guide-how-to-set-up-credentials-issuer).
:::

After issuing Rarimo credentials, you need to serve them to the users. To do that, we'll integrate RariMe snap into your DApp.

## Step #1: Add the RariMe connector

Install the RariMe connector package:

```bash
yarn add @rarimo/rarime-connector
```

<!-- TODO: need to add tabs to the theme
```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rarimo/rarime-connector
```
-->

Create a connector instance:

```js
import { enableSnap } from '@rarimo/rarime-connector'

async function createConnector() {
  const snap = await enableSnap() // connects to the snap or installs it
  const connector = await snap.getConnector()

  return connector
}
```

## Step #2: Prepare the claim offer

To fetch the credential from the issuer, we need to form a claim offer:

<!-- TODO: instruct how to get the claim schema-->

```js
// get the claim type from your schema
const CLAIM_TYPE = 'urn:uuid:6dff4518-5177-4f39-af58-9c156d9b6309'
const ISSUER_DOMAIN = 'https://issuer.example.com'

const connector = await createConnector()
const { identityIdString } = await connector.createIdentity()
const { data: claimOffer } = await fetch(
  `https://${ISSUER_DOMAIN}/v1/credentials/${identityIdString}/${CLAIM_TYPE}`
).then((res) => res.json())
```

## Step #3: Prompt user to save the credential to RariMe

Once we have the claim offer, we can prompt the user to save the credential to RariMe. To do that, we'll use the `saveCredentials` method of the connector instance:

```js
await connector.saveCredentials(claimOffer)
```

The user will be prompted to save the credential to RariMe:

:::tip
Keep the UX transparent: show the prompt only after the user explicitly clicks on the **Add credential** button or a similar UI element.
