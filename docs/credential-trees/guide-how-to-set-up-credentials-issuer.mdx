# Guide: How to set up a credentials issuer

This article details the steps to set up a Credentials Issuer, create your credentials schema, and issue the first credentials.

## Installation

Firstly, you will need to install <OutLink href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</OutLink> via the provided link.
Running the app with Docker allows for minimal installation and a quick setup.
Then, you will need to clone <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/tree/main">the repository</OutLink> or download it <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/releases/tag/v1.0.0">manually</OutLink>.

<!-- TODO: running with Docker -->

`git clone -b v1.0.0 https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node.git`

After cloning the repository, you should do the following:

1. Generate an Ethereum keypair for the Issuer Node. It will be used to sign state transitions on the Rarimo chain.

   :::note
   Currently, there is no network fee for the state transition transactions. To prevent network abuse, we maintain an allowlist of identity issuers. Contact us in <OutLink href="https://discordapp.com/invite/rarimoprotocol">Discord</OutLink> and provide the corresponding Ethereum address to get added to the allowlist.
   :::

1. In the folder you've cloned rename `.env-api.example` to `.env-api`, `.env-ui.example` to `.env-ui` and `.env-issuer.example` to `.env-issuer`.
   - `.env-api` is used to configure the api-ui.
     This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the api-ui, the server URL, and others.
   - `.env-ui` is used to configure the api-ui.
     This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the Issuer UI, the server URL, and others.
   - `.env-issuer` is used to configure the api-issuer.
     It contains the needed configuration to start the node, such as the infrastructure configuration (postgres/redis/vault), the blockchain variables to be able to publish the state, the Basic Auth variables, and other variables.
1. In the `.env-issuer` file, you need to set the variable `ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL` to a Rarimo RPC endpoint.
<!-- TODO: provide endpoints -->
1. Run `sudo make build` in the cloned folder
1. Run `sudo make private_key=YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY run-all` with the issuer's private key.
1. Check that `localhost:3001` (Issuer API) and `localhost:3002` (Issuer UI) are available.

## How to create credential schemas

If you need to create your own Credentials Schemas (some of the schemas can be found <OutLink href="https://github.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/tree/main/schemas">here</OutLink>) you can use either <OutLink href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/builder">Polygon ID Schema Builder</OutLink> (recommended option) or you can write it by yourself and import it, using Issuer UI API.

### Creating a schema with Polygon ID Schema Builder

To create the schema using Polygon ID Builder, follow these steps:

1. Enter the title, type, version, and description of your schema
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-1.png')} alt="Schema data" />
1. Define the attributes. Let's add the date of birth and the full name for this example.
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-2.png')} alt="Schema attributes" />
1. After clicking on **Add** button, a new attribute will appear, and you need to change its name, title, type, and description and set the checkbox, whether it is required or not
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-3.png')} alt="New Attribute" />
1. You can also set additional restrictions by clicking on the **Advanced** button
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-4.png')} alt="Advanced settings" />
1. After you've finished, you can copy it from the right window or download it by pressing on the **Download JSON** button below the properties
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-5.png')} alt="Receiving the Schema" />
1. Publish it somewhere (e.g., on GitHub or IPFS) and paste the link into **url** field at the **Import JSON schema** in the Issuer UI API.
   You should also copy the type, title, description, and version from the posted schema
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/schema-builder-6.png')} alt="Importing" />

## Issuing credentials

Once the issuer is ready, we can issue our first credentials.

### Using the issuer UI

1. The Issuer is also an identity, so we need to create one.
   To do that, open `localhost:3001` and select **Create Identity** in the left sidebar.
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-1.png')} alt="Identity Creation" />
1. Fill in the **method**, **blockchain**, and **network** fields.
   The **method** field is required.
   We will use the method **iden3** without specifying blockchain and network.
   We will also create an identity for the user so we can issue credentials to him.
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-2.png')} alt="Identity Created, using iden3 method" />
1. We can issue our first claim after creating both identities (or receiving the user's identity from him).
   To do that, press the **Create Claim** button and paste the Issuer identifier (our first generated ID) and user's ID in the **id** field below:
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-3.png')} alt="Create Claim" />
1. We can check our claim using the **Get Claim** endpoint:
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-4.png')} alt="Get Claim" />
1. The last thing we need to do is publish the state of our issuer on-chain
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-5.png')} alt="State publishing" />
1. Now, we can send to the user MTP of Claim inclusion in the tree, using **Get Claim MTP**
   <IdealImage img={require('/img/issuer-issue-6.png')} alt="MTP Of Claim Inclusion" />

### Issuing via API

API documentation can be found in <OutLink href="https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/blob/main/api/api.yaml">apy.yaml</OutLink>.

Follow these steps:

1. Let's issue credentials to the previously created identity:
   - the `authorization` field is Base64 encoded username and password
   - we will change the `id` (receiver's did), `birthday` and `expiration` fields
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/credentials" \
   -H "accept: application/json"\
   -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp"\
   -H "content-type: application/json" \
   -d '{
       "credentialSchema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json",
       "type": "KYCAgeCredential",
       "credentialSubject":{
           "id":"did:iden3:tQdm5KtrBAsQApF5445Wo4p8f1D5QKmAEpKWSxQaG",
           "birthday": 20000101,
           "documentType": 2
           },
       "expiration": "2023-10-27T10:56:42.618Z",
       "signatureProof": true,
       "mtProof": true }'
   ```
   The response would be the credentials ID:
   ```
   {
       "id": "b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007"
   }
   ```
1. After credentials are issued, we can publish our issuer's identity state on-chain:
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/state/publish" \
   -H "accept: application/json"\
   -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp"
   ```
   The response would be the new state, new tree roots and the txID:
   ```json
   {
     "claimsTreeRoot": "c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
     "revocationTreeRoot": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
     "rootOfRoots": "2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
     "state": "6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819",
     "txID": "0xbde3732071c9947d43a46175e47b6604b924e273ce86898f76ff621b6e48691b"
   }
   ```
1. Finally, we can make a request to the Issuer API and check that credentials exist in the tree and also receive the MTP of existence:

   ```
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/v1/claims/b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007/mtp" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
   ```

   The response would be the information about the issuer and MTP (of existence in our case):

   ```json
   {
     "issuer": {
       "claimTreeRoot": "c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
       "revocationTreeRoot": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
       "rootOfRoots": "2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
       "state": "6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819"
     },
     "mtp": {
       "existence": true,
       "siblings": [
         "10737733873451827385669539393513485246847702080273815461038732999844382514192"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
