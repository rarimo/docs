# Freedom Tool

Online voting systems are the most accessible way for people to participate in democracy, especially for those living under oppressive regimes. However, they typically lack transparency and are prone to Sybil and cyber attacks.

Rarimo has employed zero-knowledge cryptography to address these challenges and built Freedom Tool, a decentralized, transparent, and privacy-preserving online voting tool on blockchain.

## How it works

<IdealImage img={require('/img/freedom-tool-flow.png')} alt="Freedom Tool Flow" />


Here are the main components of the Freedom Tool:

- **Mobile apps**: The Freedom Tool provides mobile apps for Android and iOS that voters can use to participate in the voting process. These apps are easy to use and accessible to everyone.
- **Biometric passports**: Voters use their biometric passports to prove their identity. The mobile app scans the passport and extracts the relevant information, such as the voter's citizenship and date of birth.
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: The Freedom Tool uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the validity of the biometric passport without exposing personal data, ensuring that the voting process is private and secure.
- **Smart contracts**: The Freedom Tool uses smart contracts to handle the voting process. These contracts verify the zero-knowledge proofs and ensure the voting process is fair and reliable.

## Features

- **Privacy-preserving**: The Freedom Tool uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify the validity of biometric passports without exposing personal data.
- **Transparent**: On-chain vote records and cryptography ensure the system's integrity.
- **Accessible**: The Freedom Tool is designed to be accessible, making it easy for everyone. It is enough to have a smartphone and a biometric passport to participate in voting.
- **Secure**: The Freedom Tool relies on proven cryptographic mechanisms and was audited by independent cybersecurity specialists.
- **Open-source**: The Freedom Tool is open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the code and contribute to its development.

## Use cases

The Freedom Tool and its components can be used for a wide range of use cases, including:

- Local elections
- Polls
- Paid surveys
- NGO board elections
- Robust anti-sybil solutions based on proof of passport

## Projects using Freedom Tool

### Russia2024

The Russia2024 project, spearheaded by Russian opposition figure Mark Feygin, provides a democratic alternative to the rigged 2024 Russian presidential election. The Russia2024 app aims to establish parallel government structures to promote democracy, freedom, and peace in Russia. It garnered over 15,000 downloads on its first day.

### Iranians Vote

Launched by Iranian dissidents, the Iranians Vote project is a blockchain-powered voting app that enables citizens to protest the presidential election safely. It allows users to cast a vote of no confidence in the Islamic Republic of Iran's presidential candidates and its corrupt electoral system.

### United Space

The United Space app, initiated by Georgian opposition activists, aims to facilitate tools for liquid democracy. It offers anonymous polls for Georgian citizens, both domestic and abroad, digital versions of government documents, and tokenization of state assets.
