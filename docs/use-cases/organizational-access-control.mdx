# Organizational Access Control

## Abstract

Traditional organizations mainly have a distribution of access to resources based on the roles.
DAOs often do not have such a mechanism, but both types of organizations suffer from similar problems, mainly related to privacy.
The most obvious ones are:
- Members may fear retaliation for reporting misconduct or unethical behavior within the organization.
- Online forums, clubs, or social groups may face challenges with members expressing their opinions openly due to fear of judgment or repercussions.
- Members may be hesitant to provide candid responses if they fear their personal information will be disclosed.
- Activists involved in political movements may face risks to their safety or privacy when expressing dissenting opinions.
- DAOs suffer from the lack of private proposals, voting, and resource distribution.

Even without these problems, members would like to access files, vote, propose without revealing their private data, such as e-mail address, first and last name, telephone number, etc.

Many organizations are public in nature, e.g. volunteer organizations.
Their members often suffer from the publicity of their actions and would be much more comfortable remaining anonymous while being able to prove that they can be trusted.

## Rarimo as a solution

Rarimo's SSI solves these problems and provides many benefits, namely:
- Members have full control over their data. The user decides whether to disclose their role / name / etc or not.
- In many cases, the organization itself, in some sense will be both an issuer and a verifier.
In the case of, for example, a volunteer organization, the country's government may issue credentials for a “valid” volunteer, and he can then generate a proof of membership and present it.
- Using identity profiles, even the owner of the organization, that has issued the credential, will not be able to track who is behind the identifier, but he will be confident that this is a member of the organization.

Usually, it is enough to disclose that you are a member of the organization and, optionally, your role in it.
Zero-knowledge proofs technology allows to do it without problems.
