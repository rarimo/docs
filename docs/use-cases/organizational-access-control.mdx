# Organizational access control

## Problem statement

Typically, organizations employ role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to restricted resources. It is a proven approach, but it usually doesn't respect the privacy of the organization's members.

Privacy is especially important in the case of public on-chain actions. Leaking identifying information of the organization members gives bad actors more opportunities for social engineering or pressure.

## Rarimo's solution

Rarimo Identity Protocol solves these problems and provides many benefits:
- Members have complete control over their data. Only the user decides whether to disclose their role, name, or other identity attributes
- Zero-knowledge proofs offer a privacy-preserving way to prove the membership both on-chain and off-chain
