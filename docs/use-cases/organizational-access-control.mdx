# Organizational Access Control

## Abstract

Typically, organizations employ role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to restricted resources.
DAOs often do not have such a mechanism, but both types of organizations suffer from similar problems.

In many cases, users encounter difficulties in providing proof of their membership while maintaining anonymity.
Moreover, even if such challenges are overcome, users want to maintain control over their data and what they reveal, such as email addresses, names, phone numbers, etc.

Currently, members reveal not only their roles, but the entire account with their information, which violates their privacy.
Similarly, some part of organizations are public in nature, e.g non-profit organizations, and their members often suffer from the publicity of their actions and would be much more comfortable remaining anonymous while being able to prove that they can be trusted.

## Rarimo as a solution

Rarimo's SSI solves these problems and provides many benefits, namely:
- Members have full control over their data. The user decides whether to disclose their role / name / etc or not.
- Using identity profiles, even the issuer will not be able to track who is behind the identity, but will be able to verify the membership.

Usually, it is enough to disclose that you are a member of the organization and, optionally, your role in it.
Zero-knowledge proofs technology allows to do it without problems.
