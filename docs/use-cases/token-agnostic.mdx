# Token-Agnostic Payments

Sometimes, Web3 payments may be overwhelming: so many popular tokens, chains, and steps are involved. This abundance of options unnecessarily complicates your product and spoils the user experience. With Rarimo's token-agnostic payments, your customers can pay in any fungible token with just a few clicks. We handle the token swaps and bridging for you.

Fundamentally, the product provides four capabilities:

- Cross-chain bridging of assets backed by Rarimo Protocol;
- Token swaps using liquidity from popular DEXes such as Uniswap, PancackeSwap, and TraderJoe;
- [Rarimo's bundling technology](https://docs.rarimo.com/tutorials/bundling/) allows the inclusion of custom logic into transactions. Rarimo contracts use this logic to run actions that follow an initial transaction, such as unlocking tokens on other chains and buying NFTs;
- [Circle CCTP integration](https://docs.rarimo.com/use-cases/cctp) provides USDC liquidity for all supported chains;

By combining these features, developers can implement such cross-chain use cases as fungible token payments, NFT minting, staking, token swaps, etc.

## User Journey

Let's walk through a [demo](https://nft-checkout.rarimo.com/) and buy an NFT priced in ETH with a fungible token stored on another chain to see how it works.

1. Open the demo page [NFT Checkout demo](https://nft-checkout.rarimo.com/)
