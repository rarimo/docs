# Age restricted content

## Problem statement

Some content requires age restrictions to comply with regulations or for ethical reasons. Users may feel uncomfortable creating an account or submitting identifying documents directly on websites where they must prove their age.

## Technical Solution

Rarimo proposes a scalable, privacy-preserving age verification solution.
The protocol follows the self-sovereign identity approach and employs cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs technology.

The following benefits make the protocol uniquely well-suited for the age verification use case:

- Users fully own and control their private data.
The date of birth data from the credentials is never shared with the verifying websites.
- Zero-Knowledge technology is a state-of-the-art privacy cryptography that allows users to confirm a certain statement is true without revealing any additional information.
In this case, they can confirm that they have reached a certain age without disclosing their date of birth.
- Supports any biometric passport, eliminating the need to integrate multiple KYC providers for different regions worldwide.
- Users can prove their age once per site visit, and no one will be able to trace their previous session, giving an extra layer of anonymity;
- This solution can easily coexist with other methods of age verification, like creating an account and submitting the ID directly to the website;

## User experience

**Prerequisites**:

- The user needs to install RariMe App from <OutLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarilabs.rarime&hl=ru">Google Play Store</OutLink> or <OutLink href="https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/rarime/id6503300598">App Store</OutLink>;
- The user needs to scan his ID card or passport to receive the SSI (self-sovereign identity);

**Step #1: The user selects the "Continue incognito" option**

<IdealImage img={require('/img/arc-age-verification-request.png')} alt="Continue incognito button" />

**Step #2: User scans the QR code using RariMe App**

<IdealImage img={require('/img/arc-scan-qr-code-request.png')} alt="Scan QR code with RariMe" />

**Step #3: Generate and submit a proof of age**

<IdealImage img={require('/img/arc-generate-proof.png')} alt="Generate proof in RariMe app" />

After clicking **Generate Proof**, the user confirms the generation of a zero-knowledge proof.

**Step #4: Browse the content while the session is valid**

Incognito sessions complicate tracking user activities (views, searches, clicks, etc.) that drive the algorithmic recommendations.
To balance user engagement and privacy, we propose two possible approaches to tackling this problem:

1. Keeping the collected metrics in the user's device.
This approach offers more privacy because only the user decides what to share (using RariMe).
Also, some additional techniques can be used to obfuscate the user identity further, like mixing the user data with random noise.
The downside of this approach is the complexity of implementation.
1. Allow users to opt in for a persistent anonymous ID per site that will be used for tracking the engagements.
This way, it will be possible to see a correlation between repeated incognito sessions and thus offer personalized recommendations.
A persistent ID reduces the degree of privacy, but no personal data gets shared at any point.
