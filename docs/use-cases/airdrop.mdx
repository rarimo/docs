# Passport-enabled airdrops

## Problem statement

Token airdrops are a common way to launch new crypto projects. One of the most complex parts of a successful airdrop is preventing abuse by bots and Sybil accounts. While traditional centralized KYC providers can mitigate this issue, they are at odds with the pro-decentralization spirit of the Web3 space.

Rarimo presents a robust privacy-preserving proof of personhood solution that leverages biometric passports and zero-knowledge proofs for anti bot and Sybil resistance protection. Additionally, it allows filtering by citizenship and age while ensuring user anonymity.

## How it works

1. The user learns about the eligibility criteria and accepts the terms and conditions.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step1.png')} alt="Step 1 - agree to the Terms and conditions" />
1. The user connects a wallet

1. The user is prompted to claim the rewards.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step3.png')} alt="Step 3 - checking eligibility" />
1. After clicking the **Claim** button, the user is asked to download the RariMe App.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step4.png')} alt="Step 4 - download the app and verify your passport" />
1. The user scans a biometric passport in the app using NFC. Note that the personal data isn't shared with any third parties and remains confidential.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step5.png')} alt="Step 5 - app flow" />
1. The user is asked to generate a zero-knowledge proof of passport validity. Additionally, the proof may contain citizenship and age checks. For example, airdrops may be denied to US citizens for legal reasons.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step6.png')} alt="Step 6 - generate the zero-knowledge proof" />
1. After providing the proof, the user can claim the rewards.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step7.png')} alt="Step 7 - claim your reward" />
