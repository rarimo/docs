# Passport-enabled airdrops

## Problem statement

Token airdrops are a popular method for launching new crypto projects. However, they often face challenges like abuse by bots or Sybil accounts. Additionally, legal requirements such as citizenship and age verification can be a hurdle. While centralized KYC providers can address these issues, they contradict the decentralized nature of the Web3 space.

Rarimo stands out with its unique privacy-preserving proof of passport solution. It harnesses the power of biometric passports and zero-knowledge proofs to provide robust airdrop protection.

Proof of Passport allows airdrop organizers to:
- Verify personhood using *Proof of Passport Validity*
- Prevent sybil airdrop farming by using *Proof of Uniqueness*
- Restrict access for risky countries using *Proof of Citizenship*
- Set minimum age requirements using *Proof of Age*

## How it works

1. The user learns about the eligibility criteria and accepts the terms and conditions.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step1.png')} alt="Step 1 - agree to the Terms and conditions" />
1. The user connects a wallet
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step2.png')} alt="Step 2 - connect the wallet" />
1. The user is prompted to claim the rewards.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step3.png')} alt="Step 3 - checking eligibility" />
1. After clicking the **Claim** button, the user is asked to download the RariMe App.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step4.png')} alt="Step 4 - download the app and verify your passport" />
1. The user scans a biometric passport in the app using NFC. Note that the personal data isn't shared with any third parties and remains confidential.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step5.png')} alt="Step 5 - app flow" />
1. The user is asked to generate a zero-knowledge proof of passport validity. Additionally, the proof may contain citizenship and age checks. For example, airdrops may be denied to US citizens for legal reasons.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step6.png')} alt="Step 6 - generate the zero-knowledge proof" />
1. After providing the proof, the user can claim the rewards.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step7.png')} alt="Step 7 - claim your reward" />
