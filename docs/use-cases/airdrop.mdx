# Passport-enabled airdrops

Token airdrops are popular events on new blockchains or products. It allows making an initial list of stakeholders and introducing the project to the public.
But it comes with some limitations.

## Problem statement

If the only airdrop requirement would be to press a "Participate" button — a lot of people would abuse it, to potentially get rich in the future by using more than one account.
That's why most airdrops require some sort of anti-bot and anti-Sybil protection procedure. 
Until recently, people may needed to reveal their private data (such as their residential country) to participate in the airdrop.
Zero-knowledge proofs partially solved this problem, but not the Sybil accounts, or identity problem.

## Rarimo's solution

Rarimo as an identity platform solves both problems at once.
The user may bind their passport-based identity to the address (potentially whitelisted in the airdrop), so the airdrop maintainer may be sure, that it's indeed a real human and besides that, the person behind the address passes some optional filters by residency/age, e.g. he is not a resident of the USA, etc.

## The airdrop flow

Let's take a look at universal airdrop flow, that can be used almost everywhere, requiring minor changes:

1. User enters the airdrop page and agrees to the "Terms and Conditions".
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step1.png')} alt="Step 1 - agree to the Terms and conditions" />
1. User connects his wallet (e.g. Metamask) and, if needed, whitelist checks are performed.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step2.png')} alt="Step 2 - connect the wallet" />
1. A message indicating user's eligibility and the number of tokens reserved for their account appears after.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step3.png')} alt="Step 3 - checking eligibility" />
1. By clicking the "Claim" button, user will be asked to dowload the Rarimo App and verify his passport in it.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step4.png')} alt="Step 4 - downdload the app and verify your passport" />
1. User should scan his passport in the app to verify it and generate the identity.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step5.png')} alt="Step 5 - app flow" />
1. After generating the identity, user will be asked to generate ZKP, in our case — that he is not a US resident.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step6.png')} alt="Step 6 - generate the zkp" />
1. After providing the proof, user can claim his reward instantly or after some delay, depending on the airdrop structure.
    <IdealImage img={require('/img/airdrop-step7.png')} alt="Step 7 - claim your reward" />

As a result, we achieved the following:
- User successfully received his reward.
- User did not disclose any data, except some facts, that he agreed to reveal.
- Airdrop is fully protected from Sybil accounts and bots.
