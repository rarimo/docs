# Passport-enabled airdrops

Token airdrops are popular "events" on new blockchains or products. It allows making an initial list of stakeholders and "introducing" the project to the public.
But it comes with some limitations.

## Problem statement

If the only airdrop requirement would be to press a "Participate" button â€” a lot of people would abuse it, to potentially get rich in the future by using multiple accounts.
That's why most airdrops require some sort of KYC procedure to protect themselves.
Until recently, people may needed to reveal their private data (such as their residential country) to participate in the airdrop.
Zero-knowledge proofs partially solved this problem, but not the multi-accounts, or identity problem.

## Rarimo's solution

Rarimo as an identity platform solves both problems at once.
The user may bind their passport-based identity to the address (potentially whitelisted in the airdrop), so the airdrop maintainer may be sure, that it's indeed a real human and besides that, the person behind the address passes some checks, e.g. he is not a resident of the USA, etc.

## The airdrop flow

Let's take a look at universal airdrop flow, that can be used almost everywhere, requiring minor changes:

<!-- TODO: add flow pictures --->

1. User enters the airdrop page and agrees to the "Terms and Conditions".
1. User connects his wallet (e.g. Metamask) and, if needed, whitelist checks are performed.
1. A message indicating user's eligibility and the number of tokens reserved for their account appears after.
1. By clicking the "Claim" button, user will be asked to prove that he is a person and isn't a resident of some country (e.g. USA). Other requirements can be added as well.
1. User should download the Rarimo App and scan his passport in it. It will generate the proof and user can use it further.
1. After providing the proof, user can claim his reward instantly or after some delay, depending on the airdrop structure.

As a result, we achieved the following:
- User successfully received his reward.
- User did not disclose any data, except some facts, that he agreed to reveal.
- Airdrop is fully protected from multi-accounts and bots.
