# Multi-chain mints

Community management solutions enable you to design quests and reward users with points, credentials, tokens for completing them. Furthermore, users may form on-chain reputations via non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or SBTs issued as a result of achieving certain objectives.

In the case of some solutions, Most rewards are issued on a single chain, irrespective of the project’s native protocol that initiated the quest. The platform itself bears the cost of minting and distributing tokens.

## Cross-chain interactions without Rarimo?

The current method of organizing cross-chain interaction, in the absence of Rarimo, involves the use of various NFT bridges to enable the transfer of NFTs between different networks. However, this approach has a limitation whereby an up-to-date NFT can only exist on one network at a time. To improve interoperability, wrapped NFTs can be received on certain networks, albeit in a layered fashion. As a result, determining the original source of the NFT (NFT source) becomes more challenging.

Furthermore, to maintain the principle and intended purpose of SBT tokens, their transfer should be restricted. Typically, sending NFTs across a bridge involves transferring control of the token to the bridge contract. During this time, it becomes difficult to verify the ownership of the NFT by the user until it is on the target chain, and the proof is validated by the decentralized application deployed on the relevant contract.

## Rarimo integration

Community protocols can benefit from the integration of the Rarimo protocol because it can serve as a universal hub for various platforms and the badges (SBTs) they issue. The Rarimo protocol enables platforms to create a user's SBT and generate a cross-chain proof of its existence by updating the states on all connected networks. With Rarimo, two user scenarios cover all possible cases for verifying SBTs:

- **The SBT on demand -** feature allows users to independently choose the network where they want to mint their SBT, if they choose to do so. Subsequently, the user provides proof of the SBT's existence to the contract and mints the SBT to the required account. This functionality is crucial when the target contract necessitates on-chain SBT ownership verification or displaying on OpenSea.

- **The Proof on demand -** feature enables users to provide proof of the existence of their SBT on Rarimo directly to the destination contract, provided the target DApp is connected to the Rarimo integrator contract. The integrator contract stores the state defined by the Rarimo protocol and the mechanism used for verification, which is not memory-intensive and can contain thousands of proofs-of-existence. Additionally, this approach can be utilized during off-chain verification procedures, such as providing proof of a certificate's existence to a university.

## Fees options

1. Rarimo pays for updated states on destination networks.
   1. SBT issuers mint claims on Rarimo protocol and pays network fee
   1. After some intervals, Rarimo updates the claims state in connected networks:
      1. It can be daily, hourly, etc.
      1. It can be updated after each new claim is created
   1. Users can generate proof of ownership SBT on Rarimo and request the required contract on the destination chain. The user pays the fee for proof verification.
1. User pays for receiving state from Rarimo
   1. SBT issuers mint claims on Rarimo protocol and pays network fee
   1. The user requests the required contract and provides proof to the DApp. DApp calls Rarimo with the required state and verifies the user’s proof (through a verifier contract).
