# Cross-Chain Proofs

Rarimo enables cross-chain ownership proofs for non-fungible tokens. You can claim your identity, credentials, and certificates on any supported chain.

You should contact the team to register your specific tokens in Rarimo Protocol.

## NFTs

For transferrable tokens, you have to lock them in the Rarimo bridge smart contract.

1. Approve bridge smart contract to transfer NFT using `setApprovalForAll` method from [ERC721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L136) or [ERC1155](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L100) standard. It should be done only the first time for each NFT contract;
1. Call the deposit method on the bridge contract. For ERC721 [`depositERC721`](/bridging-protocol/smart-contracts-reference/evm#depositerc721), for ERC1155 [`depositERC1155`](/bridging-protocol/smart-contracts-reference/evm#depositerc1155). Note that you could specify some code that should be called on destination chain using [bundling feature](/bridging-protocol/guide-how-to-bundle-transactions);
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint a wrapped NFT on the destination network;

## Soulbound Tokens

SBTs are non-transferable, so they can't be locked. Thus the bridge needs to verify the sender's ownership of the token. The tokens must follow the [ERC-5192 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5192).

1. Call the [`depositSBT`](/bridging-protocol/smart-contracts-reference/evm#depositsbt) method on the bridge contract. It checks the SBT ownership and triggers the corresponding event in the Rarimo Core;
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint an SBT ownership token on the destination network;
