# Cross-chain proofs

Rarimo enables cross-chain ownership proofs for non-fungible tokens. You can claim your identity, credentials, and certificates on any supported chain.

:::info
You should contact the team to register your specific tokens in Rarimo Protocol.

## NFTs

For transferrable tokens, you have to lock them in the Rarimo bridge smart contract.

1. Approve bridge smart contract to transfer NFT using `setApprovalForAll` method from <OutLink href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L136">ERC721</OutLink> or <OutLink href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L100">ERC1155</OutLink> standard. It should be done only the first time for each NFT contract;
1. Call the deposit method on the bridge contract. For ERC721 `depositERC721`, for ERC1155 `depositERC1155`. Note that you could specify some code that should be called on destination chain using bundling feature;
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint a wrapped NFT on the destination network;

## Soulbound tokens

SBTs are non-transferable, so they can't be locked. Thus the bridge needs to verify the sender's ownership of the token. The tokens must follow the <OutLink href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5192">ERC-5192 standard</OutLink>.

1. Call the `depositSBT` method on the bridge contract. It checks the SBT ownership and triggers the corresponding event in the Rarimo Core;
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint an SBT ownership token on the destination network;
