# Problem Statement

As mentioned, the most current multi-chain solutions focus on cases where token transfers (products/bridging) suffice. Only a
few solutions are suitable for transferring different data types, including cross-chain calls. Still, even then, they
can only act as postmen for this data and cannot provide an additional layer of optimization and aggregation.

_Imagine asking a registry if it has a particular entry and, instead of receiving confirmation, being returned to the
archive and told to figure it out on your own. This is how most messaging protocols operate. They move data and
guarantee its authenticity, but the usefulness and effectiveness of this approach are questionable._

Furthermore, most solutions for cross-chain transfers of tokens and data use a similar security model - **multi-signature
and a predefined set of trusted oracles**. This model is notoriously vulnerable to hacks, leading to millions of dollars
of losses. Still, safe alternatives are few and far between, as increasing security typically drives
architectural complexity and user fees to unsustainable levels.

Additional challenges consist of complex identity nature. It operates with artifacts with different structures and
management features:

- **Account addresses** (represent assetsâ€™ owners and balances; ownership is being proved using a digital signature
  mechanism).
- **NFTs and SBTs** (represent memberships and attributes).
- **SSI states** (represent statements) and VCs (statements themselves).
- **Web3 Services** (bring web3 applications closer to the traditional web) like ENS.

It leads to and aggravates the following problems:

- **Identity fragmentation across chains**. This makes it difficult for DApps to verify users on the intended
  blockchain. It also prevents the consolidation of identity components across various chains.
- **The absence of cross-chain interoperability**. There is no structured method for interacting with third-party DApps
  on different chains or importing external assets like NFTs or SBTs from other chains.
- **Privacy concerns**. It's hard to preserve a reasonable level of anonymity or deal with sensitive data on-chain. Only
  protocols that incorporate ZK-proofs address this issue.

Summarizing all mentioned above, we can assume that the multichain messaging protocol should be focused on the following
principles:

- **Flexibility and adaptiveness** for different cases and entities (ability to efficiently operate with data, assets,
  and identity artifacts in different representation forms).
- **Interoperability and integration simplicity** (the protocol must support relevant standards of blockchain protocols
  and have a wide set of tools for integrating end applications).
- **Speed and Cost** of actions using the protocol (the protocol should aggregate the cross-chain actions into batches
  for optimizing the unit cost of a single action).
- **Security and Assurance of Interaction** (the protocol must be supported by independent parties and motivate them to
  play honestly).
