# Rarimo Protocol Vision

In this document, the features and technical details of **Rarimo** will be shown.

The primary goal is to ensure a high level of decentralization (dozens of validators) in the cross-chain area, achieve a
level of cost efficiency compared with existing decentralized solutions, and expand the multichain interactions with new
structures like **digital identity** and **social attributes**.

Rarimo will be created as a cross-chain messaging protocol with a set of sub-protocols built on top. Such architecture
will make the protocol more flexible and adapted for different use cases.

→ As a base layer, a low-level cross-chain messaging protocol is used.

→ On top of this messaging protocol, there are:

- bridging protocol that adds the functionality of securely locking/unlocking assets and has enough flexibility to build
  applications on top of this bridging logic
- identity protocol that allows issuing of digital identity artifacts and propagates them over connected networks
- oracle layer is a decentralized service that brings data from connected chains (about assets, states, and statements)

→ The third level will be applications that use the bridging protocol for different use cases.

Security of the **Rarimo** protocol will be handled by two main roles: Validators and Signers. Validators will be
responsible for two main aspects:

- Maintenance of the Rarimo blockchain
- Being an oracle that submits and checks events on connected chains (it’s presumed that the oracle role could be
  separated from the validator, but in the early stage, it is required to support the set of predefined chains by each
  validator)

Signers are part of the oracles functionality responsible for producing a threshold signature based on the actions
submitted to the Rarimo blockchain that could be used in connected chains as proof of checking events in an external
network.

The messaging protocol architecture of Rarimo can support the following verticals:

**Liquidity (Marketplaces, Defi & Lending)**

- Streamlined cross-chain NFT purchases with any ERC20
- Proof of Digital Asset Ownership and Reputation for Lending
- Bulk migration of NFTs from dying chains to thriving one's

**Compatibility (Metaverses, Gaming)**

- Quickly scale assets across chains for different metaverses
- Cross-chain NFT drops
- Brand asset migration by end users

**Access (Identity & Reputation, DAO)**

- Proof of Identity across chains
- Extension of voting rights in DAO based on holdings
- Community-enabled key recovery permissions
