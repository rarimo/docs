# Glossary

## Active Authentication (AA)

A security feature in biometric passports aimed at preventing unauthorized copying of passport data.

## Biometric Passport

A passport that includes biometric information, such as a facial photograph, typically includes an RFID chip containing data for biometric verification, personal details, an expiration date, and the issuer's digital signature.

## Circom Circuit

A Circom circuit is a computational construct used in zero-knowledge proof systems, defining constraints for efficient verification. It enables the generation and verification of proofs, preserving privacy by allowing one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing additional information.

## Decentralized Application (DApp)

A DApp is an application of one or more smart contracts running on a blockchain and a user interface.

## DG1 Personal Details

A data group within a biometric passport includes the passport holder's primary identity information, such as name, date of birth, nationality, and passport number.

## DG15: Active Authentication Public Key

The data group within a biometric passport includes the public key used for Active Authentication (AA).

## DG2 Facial Photograph

Data group within a biometric passport containing the passport holder's portrait.

## Digital autonomous organization (DAO)

A DAO is a member-owned community without centralized leadership or governing bodies.
Rarimo uses a DAO to manage its threshold signature scheme.

## Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)

EdDSA is a complex public key cryptography signature algorithm that is based on Edwards curves.

## Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

ECDSA is a complex public key cryptography signature algorithm in which keys are generated via elliptic curve cryptography.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

A computation engine that is the foundation for EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon.
See <OutLink href="https://ethereum.org">ethereum.org</OutLink>.

## Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ)

A portion of a passport that contains key personal data in a format readable by machine scanners.

## Merkle Tree

A Merkle tree stores hashes of data in a tree that allows you to verify the contents of the tree.
You can use Merkle branches to follow the hashes through the tree to verify that a specific piece of data is in the tree.

## NFC (Near Field Communication)

A technology used for short-range communication between devices, often used in passports for wireless data transfer.

## Non-fungible token (NFT)

An NFT is a piece of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique and not interchangeable with any other asset.
NFTs are different from fungible tokens such as BTC and ETH because fungible tokens are equivalent and interchangeable.

## RMO

RMO is the Rarimo token.
The RMO token is used for governance of the Rarimo project, among other things.
Users can stake RMO tokens to become oracles.

## Secp256k1

Secp256k1 refers to the parameters used in cryptography algorithms such as ECDSA.
See <OutLink href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">Secp256k1</OutLink>.

## Smart contract

Smart contracts are programs that run on EVM-compatible blockchains.
They can provide public functions and accept transactions, such as selling NFTs or exchanging tokens.
Smart contracts provide the logic for NFTs and decentralized applications.

## Soulbound Token (SBT)

Soulbound tokens are tokens that cannot be transferred.
They often represent parts of a user's identity, history, or accomplishments.

## Sparse Merkle Tree

A data structure designed for efficiently storing and verifying large data sets with minimal storage requirements.

## Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

A ZKP is a cryptographically secure piece of information that proves that a certain user meets a certain requirement without revealing any specific information about the user.
For example, a ZKP can verify that a user is above a certain age without revealing the user's actual age.

## Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK)

A zk-SNARK is the type of ZKP that Rarimo Identity Protocol uses.
One characteristic of zk-SNARKs is that they are non-interactive, meaning that the user and verifier interact only once, unlike some other types of ZKPs.

## ZK Registry

The ZK Registry is a privacy-focused on-chain registry. It enables proving system states without revealing individual details, supporting applications like identity verification and reputation systems. This design ensures data integrity and user anonymity​.

## ZK Registry Rollup

A ZK Registry Rollup is an on-chain registry used to prove system states without exposing individual data, enabling privacy-preserving applications.

## ZK Reputation

ZK Reputation allows users to prove their reputation based on private interactions or relationships using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy while verifying trustworthiness.

## ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning)

ZKML stands for Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning, which combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) with machine learning algorithms. It enables machine learning tasks to be performed on encrypted or private data without revealing the data itself, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
