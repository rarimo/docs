# Glossary

## Active Authentication (AA)

A security feature in biometric passports aimed at preventing unauthorized copying of passport data.

## Biometric Passport

A passport that includes biometric information, such as a facial photograph, typically includes an RFID chip containing data for biometric verification, personal details, an expiration date, and the issuer's digital signature.

## Bionetta

Bionetta is a client-side framework for generating secure and private inference proofs using Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML).

## Circom Circuit

A Circom circuit is a computational construct used in zero-knowledge proof systems, defining constraints for efficient verification. It enables the generation and verification of proofs, preserving privacy by allowing one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing additional information.

## Decentralized Application (DApp)

A DApp is an application of one or more smart contracts running on a blockchain and a user interface.

## DG1 Personal Details

A data group within a biometric passport includes the passport holder's primary identity information, such as name, date of birth, nationality, and passport number.

## DG15: Active Authentication Public Key

The data group within a biometric passport includes the public key used for Active Authentication (AA).

## DG2 Facial Photograph

Data group within a biometric passport containing the passport holder's portrait.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

A computation engine that is the foundation for EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon.
See <OutLink href="https://ethereum.org">ethereum.org</OutLink>.

## Freedom Tool

A decentralized, transparent, and privacy-preserving online voting tool on the blockchain.

## Fuzzy Extractors

A cryptographic technique used for account recovery with noisy data, like images, without storing the raw data.

## Groth16

A specific type of zk-SNARK proof system used in Bionetta and ZK Passport for efficient proof generation.

## L1

Layer 1 blockchain, referring to the main Ethereum network in the context of the ZK Registry.

## L2

Layer 2 scaling solution, referring to the Rarimo ZK Rollup network.

## Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ)

A portion of a passport that contains key personal data in a format readable by machine scanners.

## Merkle Tree

A Merkle tree stores hashes of data in a tree that allows you to verify the contents of the tree.
You can use Merkle branches to follow the hashes through the tree to verify that a specific piece of data is in the tree.

## NFC (Near Field Communication)

A technology used for short-range communication between devices, often used in passports for wireless data transfer.

## Non-fungible token (NFT)

An NFT is a piece of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique and not interchangeable with any other asset.
NFTs are different from fungible tokens such as BTC and ETH because fungible tokens are equivalent and interchangeable.

## Nullifier

A unique value used to prevent double-voting or double-spending in a privacy-preserving way.

## Poseidon Hashing

A hash function optimized for zero-knowledge proof systems, used in the ZK Registry and Seedless Recovery.

## Query Proof

A zero-knowledge proof that verifies specific information from a biometric passport or other identity document.

## RMO

RMO is the Rarimo token.
The RMO token is used for governance of the Rarimo project, among other things.
Users can stake RMO tokens to become oracles.

## Rarimo App

A mobile application that turns a biometric passport into an anonymous digital ID.

## Seedless Recovery

An innovative, visual approach to crypto account recovery using physical objects or biometrics.

## Smart contract

Smart contracts are programs that run on EVM-compatible blockchains.
They can provide public functions and accept transactions, such as selling NFTs or exchanging tokens.
Smart contracts provide the logic for NFTs and decentralized applications.

## Sparse Merkle Tree

A data structure designed for efficiently storing and verifying large data sets with minimal storage requirements.

## ZK Graph

ZK Graph allows users to prove their reputation based on private interactions or relationships using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy while verifying trustworthiness.

## ZK Likeness

ZK Likeness is a ZKML solution powered by the Bionetta framework. It verifies that two faces belong to the same person without revealing any biometric data, enabling privacy-preserving face recognition for various applications.

## ZK Liveness

A solution to verify that a user is a live person, used in conjunction with ZK Likeness.

## ZK Passport

A solution that allows users to prove their identity on-chain without revealing private data from their passport.

## ZK Registry

The ZK Registry is a privacy-focused on-chain registry. It enables proving system states without revealing individual details, supporting applications like identity verification and reputation systems. This design ensures data integrity and user anonymity​.

## ZK Registry Rollup

A ZK Registry Rollup is an on-chain registry used to prove system states without exposing individual data, enabling privacy-preserving applications.

## ZKML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning)

ZKML stands for Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning, which combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) with machine learning algorithms. It enables machine learning tasks to be performed on encrypted or private data without revealing the data itself, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.

## Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

A ZKP is a cryptographically secure piece of information that proves that a certain user meets a certain requirement without revealing any specific information about the user.
For example, a ZKP can verify that a user is above a certain age without revealing the user's actual age.

## Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK)

A zk-SNARK is the type of ZKP that Rarimo Identity Protocol uses.
One characteristic of zk-SNARKs is that they are non-interactive, meaning that the user and verifier interact only once, unlike some other types of ZKPs.
