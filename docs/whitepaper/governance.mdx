# Governance

The first structure of the governance will be prescribed by the smart contract, and, after that, for enhancement of the
governance model, it can be changed by the DAO.

Initially, any RMO holder can participate. To submit a proposal, its creator blocks part of the Tokens, which will be
burned if the other participants consider such a proposal to be a fraud. Then the voting round begins. An epoch lasting
2 weeks is allocated for voting. Suppose a simple majority of all voters support the proposal. In that case, it is
deemed as accepted, and the protocol should be updated, provided that certain requirements concerning the quorum are
met. The creator of the request receives a reward, the amount of which is determined by the protocol. If the proposal is
not accepted and users do not consider this proposal a fraud, the blocked Tokens will be returned to the user's account.

It is suggested that in the future, the governance structure will be as follows:
1. on-chain governance, in which any RMO holder can participate
2. off-chain ministerial structure, which is created by the DAO and the main and sole function of which may be the
implementation of decisions of the on-chain governance.
