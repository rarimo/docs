# Utilities of the Token
## Fees
Payment of fees inside the Rarimo protocol - main utility function of the Token. The DAO will set the exact types of
fees and their structure. It is suggested, as for now, that the Rarimo protocol may have the following 2 types of fees:

1. fee that should be paid in RMO Token. This fee covers operations with transferring  Tokens and messages over the
connected networks
2. fees that can be paid in the platform-supported assets. This kind of fee covers transfers of ERC20 tokens through the
bridge

## Governance
As described below, Tokens will be used as a governance tool for the DAO.

## Selecting validators of the Rarimo core
The token is also designed to achieve Rarimo security. The smart contract sets a minimum RMO to send the transaction for
being a validator. As soon as a node has a set amount of staked RMO, other Token holders can stake some amount of their
Tokens for this node. The nodes for which the most Tokens were staked become the guarantors of the protocol. This way,
you can get a truly democratic choice of protocol validators. The DAO may change the described rules.

If the verifier did some violation - any user can report that (on-chain transaction). If other users approve the fact of
the violation (via voting procedure) - the stake of the validator transfers to the community pool. By default, there are
only 2 types of violations that presume a 100% stake validator penalty - the signing of 2 or more blocks of the same
height and an attempt to add conflicting transactions within one block.

## Payments for signers for bringing and confirming external data
The last significant reason the RMO token exists is - a reward for bringing the data to the Rarimo core from connected
networks. In this condition, the level of decentralization of the Oracle layer really matters. Separating (on the
technical and economic layers) this role from the validator node allows everyone to select accounting systems for
indexing based on their existing infrastructure and other assumptions.
