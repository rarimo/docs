# Light wallets supporting

This approach save users from completely synchronizing history with Rarimo core. Users and auditors can use a light
wallet to work with the system. Thus, it stores only the block headers (and evidence), but at the same time, the user
can quickly check and prove the status of each necessary transaction. That is, a light client can request a witness from
any full node and check that it was generated for the desired transaction and can be used to receive the message from
the Rarimo Contract.
