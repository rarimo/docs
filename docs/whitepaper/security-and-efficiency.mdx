# Security and efficiency
The security of the solution is based on the validator quorum (the set of validators that maintain the system). But at
the same time, it should be understood that an increase in the number of validators who are responsible for managing the
bridge leads to an increase in asset transfer time.

## Asset transfer time
The time of migrating an asset or message is equal to the sum of 1)  block confirmation time in the parent blockchain; 2)
consensus time in the Rarimo core; 3) block confirmation time in the destination blockchain. The time to reach
consensus in the Rarimo core can be considered insignificant in relation to the time to reach consensus (about ensuring
irreversibility) in external open networks (it will take approximately from 5 to 7 seconds).

## Threshold signature
The threshold signature scheme t-of-n is a scheme that presumes the participation of t+1 parties for creating a valid signature value.

The threshold signature consists of 2 principal parts:
1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG): Some secret key is constructed (from secrets of all parties). At the end of a DKG,
every party possesses some secret share from which the main secret key can be recovered. Each participant doesn’t know
about the shares of other parties. This process is performed in 4 rounds. It’s important to note that this scheme is
different from the scheme with the trusted dealer, who has knowledge about the initial secret.
2. Signing itself. Any t+1 parties can sign a message, producing a single valid signature. This process is performed in
7 rounds (including 1 online) for the ECDSA signature scheme and in 3 rounds for EdDSA.

Note that the size of the threshold signature (and the algorithm for its verification) doesn’t depend on the number of
parties involved. It means that the cost of signature verification will be the same as in the case of a single signature.
