# Bridge Protocol Contracts

Rarimo's decentralized bridge contracts are responsible for managing deposits and withdrawals for native, fungible, and non-fungible tokens.

Rarimo currently supports the following token types:

- Native tokens;
- ERC20 fungible tokens;
- ERC721 non-fungible tokens(including SBT);
- ERC1155 tokens;
- MetaplexFT;
- MetaplexNFT;
- NearFT;
- NearNFT;

## General Bridging Flow

At the high level, cross-chain token bridging consists of the following steps:

1. The user deposits tokens to the bridge contract on the source chain;
2. The bridge contract emits an event containing the deposit details;
3. Rarimo oracles observe the deposit event on the source chain and submit it for processing;
4. Rarimo validators form a threshold signature(TSS) to approve the deposit operation;
5. A relayer picks up the signed deposit and calls the corresponding withdrawal method of the bridge contract on the destination chain;
6. The bridge contract verifies the TSS signature and t the funds to the recipient address;

## Implementations

Currently, there are three implementations of a Rarimo bridge contract:

- [EVM bridge](/reference/contracts/bridge/evm);
- [Solana bridge](/reference/contracts/bridge/solana);
- [Near bridge](/reference/contracts/bridge/near);
