# EVM Bridge Contract

We use the same contract interfaces for all EVM-compatible blockchains we support. These interfaces are available on `npm` and `github`.
You can use this page to reference the interface and capabilities of our deployed contracts quickly.

## General Notes

### Emitted Events

Each of these methods will emit an event in a standardized way.
For example, the `DepositNative` will emit an event of `DepositedNative` when called.
All parameters passed in will be part of the emitted event in the same order, except the bundle parameter - this will be unwrapped and logged as two separate parameters (salt and bundle).

### Bundling

Each method accepts a bundle parameter, a tuple of salt, and a bundle.
The salt determines a proxy address, while the bundle is an encoded transaction bundle.

### Network Parameters

To ensure that our protocol works with all blockchains, not just EVM-compatible ones, the destination network is a simple string.

## DepositNative

### Interface

```solidity
function depositNative(
  DepositFeeNativeParameters calldata feeParams_,
  IBridge.DepositNativeParameters calldata depositParams_
) external payable;

struct DepositFeeNativeParameters {
  address feeToken;
}

struct DepositNativeParameters {
  uint256 amount;
  IBundler.Bundle bundle;
  string network;
  string receiver;
}
```

### Parameters

- `feeParams_` struct, which represents fee parameters for the native deposit, consists of:
  - `feeToken` is the address of the fee token
- `depositParams_` struct, which represents native deposit parameters, consists of:
  - `amount` the amount of deposited native tokens
  - `bundle` used for transaction bundling _tuple (bytes32 salt, bytes bundle)_
  - `network` network name destination of the transfer
  - `receiver` receiver address in the destination chain

As the `DepositNative` method is called to transfer native coins from a source to a destination, the method signature is essential.
You will need to pass in the amount of native coin in the `depositParams_` structure that you want to send to the protocol.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that could transfer 100000 WEI from Ethereum to Polygon (where it could be withdrawn as Wrapped ETH ERC20).

```javascript
await rarimoContract.despositNative(
  {
    salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    bundle: "0x",
  },
  "polygon",
  "0x",
  {
    gasLimit: 50000,
    value: 100000,
  }
);
```

## DepositERC20

### Interface

```solidity

function depositERC20(
  DepositFeeERC20Parameters calldata feeParams_,
  IBridge.DepositERC20Parameters calldata depositParams_
) external payable;

struct DepositFeeERC20Parameters {
  address feeToken;
}

struct DepositERC20Parameters {
  address token;
  uint256 amount;
  IBundler.Bundle bundle;
  string network;
  string receiver;
  bool isWrapped;
}
```

### Parameters

- `feeParams_` struct, which represents fee parameters for the ERC20 deposit, consists of:
  - `feeToken` the address of the fee token
- `depositParams_` struct, which represents ERC20 deposit parameters, consists of:
  - `token` source contract address for the fungible tokens being transferred
  - `amount` how many tokens are being transferred
  - `bundle` used for transaction bundling _tuple (bytes32 salt, bytes bundle)_
  - `network` network name destination of the transfer
  - `receiver` receiver address in the destination chain
  - `isWrapped` whether the tokens will be burned (true) or transferred (false)

You can use the `DepositERC20` method to move fungible tokens from a source to a destination.
When you call this, you must decide if you want to burn or attempt an actual transfer.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that will transfer 10 USDT from Avalanche to Solana by burning & minting tokens in each chain.

```javascript
await rarimoContract.depositERC20(
  "0xc7198437980c041c805a1edcba50c1ce5db95118",
  10,
  {
    salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    bundle: "0x",
  },
  "solana",
  "0x",
  true
);
```

## DepositERC721

### Interface

```solidity
function depositERC721(
  DepositFeeERC721Parameters calldata feeParams_,
  IBridge.DepositERC721Parameters calldata depositParams_
) external payable;

struct DepositFeeERC721Parameters {
  address feeToken;
}

struct DepositERC721Parameters {
  address token;
  uint256 tokenId;
  IBundler.Bundle bundle;
  string network;
  string receiver;
  bool isWrapped;
}
```

### Parameters

- `feeParams_` struct, which represents fee parameters for the ERC721 deposit, consists of:
  - `feeToken` is the address of the fee token
- `depositParams_` struct, which represents ERC721 deposit parameters, consists of:
  - `token` source contract address for NFT contract
  - `tokenId` id of the token to be transferred
  - `bundle` used for transaction bundling _tuple (bytes32 salt, bytes bundle)_
  - `network` network name destination of the transfer
  - `receiver` receiver address in the destination chain
  - `isWrapped` whether the tokens will be burned (true) or transferred (false)

The `DepositERC721` method is used to move a single NFT from a contract to another chain.
Similar to ERC20s, when you call this, you need to decide if you want to burn or attempt a true transfer.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that will transfer an NFT from Binance to Ethereum by a raw transfer.

```javascript
await rarimoContract.depositERC721(
  "0x12786C473E6d6bB78E554c90812772bEad18264e",
  996800003035,
  {
    salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    bundle: "0x",
  },
  "ethereum",
  "0x",
  false
);
```

## DepositERC1155

### Interface

```solidity
function depositERC1155(
  DepositFeeERC1155Parameters calldata feeParams_,
  IBridge.DepositERC1155Parameters calldata depositParams_
) external payable;

struct DepositFeeERC1155Parameters {
  address feeToken;
}

struct DepositERC1155Parameters {
  address token;
  uint256 tokenId;
  uint256 amount;
  IBundler.Bundle bundle;
  string network;
  string receiver;
  bool isWrapped;
}
```

### Parameters

- `feeParams_` struct, which represents fee parameters for the ERC1155 deposit, consists of:
  - `feeToken` is the address of the fee token
- `depositParams_` struct, which represents ERC1155 deposit parameters, consists of:
  - `token` source contract address for NFT contract
  - `tokenId`, which token is being transferred
  - `amount` how many fungible tokens to include
  - `bundle` used for transaction bundling _tuple (bytes32 salt, bytes bundle)_
  - `network` network name destination of the transfer
  - `receiver` receiver address in the destination chain
  - `isWrapped` whether the tokens will be burned (true) or transferred (false)

The `DepositERC1155` method is used to move either non-fungible or fungible tokens from an ERC1155.
Predictably, the interface is a combination of the ERC20 and ERC721 methods.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that will transfer 10 SLI fungible tokens from Polygon to NEAR by burning & minting.

```javascript
await rarimoContract.depositERC1155(
  "0x22d5f9B75c524Fec1D6619787e582644CD4D7422",
  0,
  10,
  {
    salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    bundle: "0x",
  },
  "near",
  "0x",
  true
);
```

## DepositSBT

### Interface

```solidity
function depositSBT(
  DepositFeeSBTParameters calldata feeParams_,
  IBridge.DepositSBTParameters calldata depositParams_
) external payable;

struct DepositFeeSBTParameters {
  address feeToken;
}

struct DepositSBTParameters {
  address token;
  uint256 tokenId;
  IBundler.Bundle bundle;
  string network;
  string receiver;
}
```

### Parameters

- `feeParams_` struct, which represents fee parameters for the SBT deposit, consists of:
  - `feeToken` is the address of the fee token
- `depositParams_` struct, which represents SBT deposit parameters, consists of:
  - `token` source contract address for NFT contract
  - `tokenId` which token is being transferred
  - `bundle` used for transaction bundling _tuple (bytes32 salt, bytes bundle)_
  - `network` network name destination of the transfer
  - `receiver` receiver address in the destination chain

The `depositSBT` method mints a wrapped SBT on another chain. The token must follow the [ERC-5192 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5192).

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that will transfer an NFT from Binance to Ethereum by a raw transfer.

```javascript
await rarimoContract.depositSBT(
  "0x12786C473E6d6bB78E554c90812772bEad18264e",
  996800003035,
  {
    salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
    bundle: "0x",
  },
  "ethereum",
  "0x"
);
```
