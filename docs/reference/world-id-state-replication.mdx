# World ID State Replication

This page contains technical resources related to the World ID State Replication.

## Identity Relayer

This service replicates identity states on demand.
It should be called before submitting proof on the destination chain.

For the full implementation, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rarimo/worldcoin-relayer-svc).
For more information about API, see [Identity transfers](https://rarimo.github.io/rarimo-core/docs/common/bridging/002-identity.html).

### Relayer endpoints

To perform state publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/state/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Avalanche",
  "hash": "0x212bc6f8194aa63eee97b0566b7cd65c66bb57cc4936c11e611f1042bb0b7118",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

- `"chain": "chain_name"` - chain, to which the state will be relayed;
- `"hash": "0x..."` - hash of the state to relay. Same as on the state contract in 0x... hex format;
- `"waitConfirm": true` indicates whether the request should wait until the transaction is included in the block (`false` by default);

The response codes:
- `200` - successful relay, body contains tx hash;
- `404` - the state is not transferred yet; try to repeat the request later;
- `400` - state has been relayed before;

##  Smart Contracts


### `IdentityManager`

<!-- TODO: add Deployments -->

It's a modified identity contract meant for the destination chains.
It checks a TSS from the Rarimo validators to transit the state and only holds a partial history.
The relayer service lazily updates the contract whenever a user wants to submit ZKP on a particular chain.


#### Interface

```solidity
contract IdentityManager is IIdentityManager, Signers {

    uint256 public constant ROOT_EXPIRATION_TIME = 1 hours;

    address public sourceStateContract;

    uint256 internal _latestRoot;

    uint256 internal _latestTimestamp;

    mapping(uint256 => RootData) internal _roots;

    function signedTransitRoot(
        uint256 prevRoot_,
        uint256 postRoot_,
        uint256 replacedAt_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external override {
	// ...

        emit SignedRootTransited(prevRoot_, postRoot_, replacedAt_, _latestRoot);
    }
}
```

- `ROOT_EXPIRATION_TIME` — a fixed time after which the root is considered "expired", i.e., proofs with it are considered invalid after that;
- `sourceStateContract` — address of the state contract on the source chain (Rarimo);
- `_latestRoot` — latest (and newest) transited root;
- `_latestTimestamp` — timestamp of latest root replacement;
- `_roots` — mapping of roots to data about these roots (replacement timestamp and root that replaced this one).
It is updated after the transition is done;
- `signedTransitRoot(...)` — the main function that adds the information to the history (`_roots`).
It changes the `_latestRoot` if `postRoot_` is newer.
Requires the threshold signature of Rarimo signature providers.
Also, emits the `SignedRootTransited` event, which contains information about the transition (both roots, timestamp of replacement, and current latest root);

For the full implementation, see [IdentityManager.sol](https://github.com/rarimo/worldid-integration-contracts/blob/master/contracts/IdentityManager.sol) at the GitHub.

### `Verifier`

<!-- TODO: add Deployments -->

It's an implementation of a verifier contract.
You can add your business logic to it by modifying (or overriding) two hooks – `_beforeProofSubmit` and `_afterProofSubmit`;


#### Interface

```solidity
contract Verifier is IVerifier, Initializable {

    address public semaphoreVerifier;
    address public identityManager;

    function verifyProof(
        uint256 root_,
        uint256 signalHash_,
        uint256 nullifierHash_,
        uint256 externalNullifierHash_,
        uint256[8] calldata proof_
    ) public virtual override {
        // ...

        _beforeProofValidation();

        ISemaphoreVerifier(semaphoreVerifier).verifyProof(
            proof_,
            [root_, nullifierHash_, signalHash_, externalNullifierHash_]
        );

        _afterProofValidation();
    }

    function _beforeProofValidation() internal virtual {}

    function _afterProofValidation() internal virtual {}
}

```

- `semaphoreVerifier` — address of the `SemaphoreVerifier` contract that verifies the proof;
- `identityManager` — address of the `IdentityManager` contract;
- `verifyProof(...)` —  the main function that verifies the user's proof.
It calls the `IdentityManager` to verify whether the root is actual and `SemaphoreVerifier` to verify the proof itself;
- `_beforeProofValidation()` — hook that should be executed before the `verifyProof(...)`;
- `_afterProofValidation()` — hook that gets executed after the `verifyProof(...)` call;

For the full implementation, see [Verifier.sol](https://github.com/rarimo/worldid-integration-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Verifier.sol) at the GitHub.

### `SemaphoreVerifier`

<!-- TODO: add Deployments -->

This contract is responsible for verifying the ZKP.
It has some necessary math functions, constants, and the primary `verifyProof(...)` function.
It allows proofs to be verified in uncompressed or compressed form.
Usually, uncompressed form is used, see [BN254 Point Compression](https://2π.com/23/bn254-compression) for further explanation.

#### Interface

```solidity
contract SemaphoreVerifier is ISemaphoreVerifier {

    /* ... */

    function verifyCompressedProof(
        uint256[4] calldata compressedProof,
        uint256[4] calldata input
    ) public view {
        // ...
    }

    function verifyProof(uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[4] calldata input) public view {
        // ...
    }
}
```

- `verifyCompressedProof(...)` —  verifies a compressed proof;
- `verifyProof(...)` — verifies an uncompressed proof;

For the full implementation, see [SemaphoreVerifier.sol](https://github.com/rarimo/worldid-integration-contracts/blob/master/contracts/vendor/worldcoin/world-id-contracts/SemaphoreVerifier.sol) at the GitHub.
