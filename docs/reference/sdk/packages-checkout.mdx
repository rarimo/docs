# Checkout packages

The Rarimo SDK checkout packages provide tools to send transactions to blockchains.

For information about creating transactions, see [Creating NFT checkout transactions](../tutorials/creating-transactions).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

## @rarimo/nft-checkout

The [@rarimo/nft-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/nft-checkout) package provides tools that swap tokens and create cross-chain transactions based on the Rarimo protocol.

For information about swapping tokens, see [Swapping tokens](../tutorials/swapping-tokens).

## @rarimo/react-nft-checkout

The [@rarimo/react-nft-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-nft-checkout) package provides React components that you can use in your UI to create cross-chain transactions with the Rarimo protocol.

For information about creating transactions with this package, see [Creating NFT checkout transactions](../tutorials/creating-transactions).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

### React transaction flow

The transaction flow starts with the `DappContextProvider` and `RarimoPayButton` components:

When a user clicks the button, the `RarimoPayDialog` component opens, prompting the user to select the wallet to use.
It includes the `PaymentWallets` and `CheckoutModal` components, which list the wallets detected in the browser:

When the user selects a wallet and logs in to it, the `RarimoPayDialog` component shows the `BridgeChainSelect` component, which prompts the user to select a chain:

When the user selects a chain, the dialog updates to show the tokens in the wallet in the `PaymentTokensList` component:

When the user clicks a token, the dialog opens a `LoadingIndicator` component as it retrieves prices.
Then the dialog shows the price of the transaction and the fees involved.

If the wallet has enough of the selected token, the dialog shows the transaction fees and prompts the user to complete the transaction, as in this example:
