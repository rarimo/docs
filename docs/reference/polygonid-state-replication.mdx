# Polygon ID State Replication

This page contains technical resources related to the [Polygon ID State Replication](/use-cases/polygon-id).

## Demo DApp

Users can check out how the state replication works using our demo DApp. Leveraging the state replication lets users submit a Polygon ID zero-knowledge proof on Ethereum. Users get an SBT as a reward.

Testnet(Sepolia): https://polygon.mainnet-beta.rarimo.com/

## Identity Relayer

This service replicates GIST roots and identity states on demand.
Call it before submitting proof on the destination chain.

- Github: https://github.com/rarimo/identity-relayer-svc
- API Reference: https://rarimo.github.io/rarimo-core/docs/common/bridging/002-identity.html
- Testnet URI: https://api.mainnet-beta.rarimo.com/integrations/relayer/

### Relayer endpoints

To perform state publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/state/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Ethereum",
  "hash": "0x212bc6f8194aa63eee97b0566b7cd65c66bb57cc4936c11e611f1042bb0b7118",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

To perform GIST publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/gist/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Ethereum",
  "hash": "0x1e4b74c14388fbfca27496828d24c248637792eb0286e7519860abb3ec01bc70",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

- `"chain": "chain_name"` - chain, to which the state (or gist) will be relayed;
- `"hash": "0x..."` - hash of the state (or gist) to relay. Same as on the state contract in 0x... hex format;
- `"waitConfirm": true` indicates whether the request should wait until the transaction is included in the block (`false` by default);

The response codes:

- `200` - successful relay, body contains tx hash;
- `404` - the state is not transferred yet; try to repeat the request later;
- `400` - state has been relayed before;

## Smart Contracts

<!-- TODO: Add mainnet contracts addresses -->

### `LightweightStateV2`

It's a modified state contract meant for the destination chains.
It checks a TSS from the Rarimo validators instead of a ZKP to transit the state and only holds a partial history.
The relayer service lazily updates the contract whenever a user wants to submit ZKP on a particular chain.

#### Interface

```solidity
contract LightweightStateV2 is ILightweightStateV2, UUPSSignableUpgradeable, Signers {
    address public override sourceStateContract;

    uint256 internal _currentGistRoot;

    mapping(uint256 => GistRootData) internal _gistsRootData;

    mapping(uint256 => IdentityInfo) internal _identitiesInfo;

    function signedTransitGISTData(
        uint256 prevGist_,
        GistRootData calldata gistData_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external override {
        // ...

        emit SignGISTDataTransited(gistData_.root, prevGist_);
    }

    function signedTransitStateData(
        uint256 prevState_,
        StateData calldata stateData_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external override {
        // ...

        emit SignStateDataTransited(stateData_.id, stateData_.state, prevState_);
    }
}

```

- `sourceStateContract` — address of the state contract on the source chain (Rarimo);
- `_currentGistRoot` — the latest transferred GIST root;
- `_gistsRootData` — mapping of the GIST roots to their data.
  Data stores two roots, one that replaced the other, timestamp and block number;
- `_identitiesInfo` — mapping of the identity IDs to the information about this identity.
  Information has the latest identity state and the history of the states with timestamps;
- `signedTransitGISTData()` — adds the GIST root to the history and changes the current root variable if the proposed one is newer;
- `signedTransitStateData(...)` — adds the state to the history and sets the last state of the identity to the provided one if it's newer;

Both functions require proof of change — TSS of Rarimo signature providers.
Also, core functions emit events, which contain the data about changes:

- `SignGISTDataTransited` contains the data about roots, the previous one and the provided one;
- `SignStateDataTransited` contains the provided identity state, previous state, and identity ID;

Full implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/rarimo/polygonid-integration-contracts/blob/master/contracts/LightweightStateV2.sol).

### `QueryVerifier`

It's an implementation of a verifier contract that inherits Iden3 [ZKPVerifier](https://github.com/iden3/contracts/blob/master/contracts/verifiers/ZKPVerifier.sol) that mints an SBT.
It is configured to work with the KYCAge demo credential.

#### Interface

```solidity
contract QueryVerifier is IQueryVerifier, ZKPVerifier {
    uint256 public constant AGE_VERIFY_REQUEST_ID = 1;

    IVerifiedSBT public override sbtContract;

    mapping(address => uint256) public override addressToUserId;

    mapping(uint256 => VerificationInfo) internal _verificationsInfo;

    function _beforeProofSubmit(
        uint64,
        uint256[] memory inputs_,
        ICircuitValidator
    ) internal override {
        require(
            !isUserVerified(_getIdentityId(inputs_)),
            "QueryVerifier: identity with this identifier has already been verified"
        );
        require(
            addressToUserId[msg.sender] == 0,
            "QueryVerifier: current address has already been used to verify another identity"
        );
    }

    function _afterProofSubmit(
        uint64,
        uint256[] memory inputs_,
        ICircuitValidator
    ) internal override {
        uint256 tokenId_ = sbtContract.nextTokenId();
        uint256 userId_ = _getIdentityId(inputs_);

        _verificationsInfo[userId_] = VerificationInfo(msg.sender, tokenId_);
        addressToUserId[msg.sender] = userId_;

        sbtContract.mint(msg.sender);

        emit Verified(userId_, msg.sender, tokenId_);
    }
}
```

- `AGE_VERIFY_REQUEST_ID` — hard-coded KYC demo request ID;
- `sbtContract` — address of the SBT contract, which will be called to mint Soulbound token;
- `addressToUserId` — mapping of addresses to user's identity ID;
- `_verificationsInfo` — mapping of user's identity ID to the verification information, which contains the prover address and minted token ID;
- `_beforeProofSubmit` — hook that performs some necessary security checks;
- `_afterProofSubmit` — another hook, which mints the SBT in case of valid verification;

The function that verifies the ZKP - `verify(...)` is inherited from the [ZKPVerifier](https://github.com/iden3/contracts/blob/master/contracts/verifiers/ZKPVerifier.sol) contract.

Full implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/rarimo/polygonid-integration-contracts/blob/master/contracts/QueryVerifier.sol).

### `VerifiedSBT`

The SBT is awarded to users who complete the Polygon ID x Rarimo demo.

- `tokensURI` — token's picture URI;
- `onlyVerifier()` — modifier that allows calls only by the verifier contract;
- `mint(address)` — mints the SBT for the given address;
- `_beforeTokenTransfer(...)` — prevents the token from being transferred (only burn and mint are available);
