# Guide: How to Set Up Polygon ID State Replication

In this guide, we'll set up the cross-chain identity state replication for Polygon ID. It enables the usage of Polygon ID zero-knowledge proofs on any chain supported by Rarimo.

For more information about how the Polygon ID identity state transfer works, visit [rarimo-core docs](https://github.com/rarimo/rarimo-core/blob/master/docs/common/bridging/002-identity.md).

## Pre-Requisites

Before getting started, please contact us in [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/rarimoprotocol) to ensure that the issuer is added to the allowlist and that a lightweight state contract is already deployed to the destination chain;

Other pre-requisites:

- [Postgres DB 13+](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) instance for the relayer service;
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional)

## Setting Up Relayer

The Relayer service is responsible for replicating the Polygon ID state on demand. It exposes a REST endpoint for the DApps that performs the state replication to the target chain.

### Build

You can pull the pre-build docker image:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/rarimo/identity-relayer-svc:v1.0.3
```

Or clone the [repository](https://github.com/rarimo/identity-relayer-svc) and build it from the source:

<!-- TODO: fix docker image -->

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rarimo/identity-relayer-svc.git

CGO_ENABLED=1 go build .
```

## Configuration

Service configuration consists of two parts:

### Environment

```shell
export KV_VIPER_FILE=/config.yaml
```

### Config file

```yaml
log:
  disable_sentry: true
  level: debug

# The port to run on
listener:
  addr: :8000

# PostgreSQL DB connect
db:
  url: 'postgres://relayer:relayer@relayer-db:5432/relayer?sslmode=disable'

# Rarimo core RPCs
core:
  addr: tcp://core-api.mainnet-beta.rarimo.com:26657

cosmos:
  addr: rpc.node1.mainnet-beta.rarimo.com:9090

evm:
  chains:
    - name: 'Ethereum'
      ## Address of the modified state contract on target chain
      contract_address: ''
      ## Private key HEX (without leading 0x) that will pay the tx fee
      submitter_private_key: ''
      ##  RPC address. Example https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/11111
      rpc:
      ## Target chain id
      chain_id: 1

relay:
  # Flag the indicates should service iterate over all existing transfer operation and fill the database
  catchup_disabled: true
```

---

## Run

### Binary Built From Source

```sh
# apply DB migrations and run the service
./relayer-svc migrate up && ./relayer-svc run all
```

### Using `docker-compose`

1. Put the config at `./config.yaml`
1. Create `./docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.7'

   services:
     relayer-db:
       image: postgres:13
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=relayer
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=relayer
         - POSTGRES_DB=relayer
         - PGDATA=/pgdata
       volumes:
         - relayer-data:/pgdata

     relayer:
       image: ghcr.io/rarimo/identity-relayer-svc:v1.0.3
       restart: on-failure
       ports:
         - '8000:8000'
       depends_on:
         - relayer-db
       volumes:
         - ./config.yaml:/config.yaml
       environment:
         - KV_VIPER_FILE=/config.yaml
       entrypoint: sh -c "relayer-svc migrate up && relayer-svc run all"
   volumes:
     relayer-data:
   ```

1. Run the service:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Using Service

Execute the POST `/integrations/relayer/relay` request with the following body to fetch state publishing:

```json
{
  "chain": "Sepolia",
  "state": "0x24d76fbb1ba771df400f4d61d161a4a761675f14a2f35faf6d6d67e6d8be5fe6"
}
```

The response will be:

- `200` – successful relay, tx hash in the response body;
- `404` – the state wasn't ingested by Rarimo Core yet; wait a little and repeat the request;
- `400` – the state has been relayed before; <!-- TODO: fix me -->
