ZK Liveness is a ZKML solution powered by [Bionetta ZKML framework](/zkml-bionetta) designed to verify the presence of a live person in online interactions, preventing spoofing attacks. It allows users to prove their liveness without revealing any personal information or biometric data. Currently, ZK Liveness achieves **accuracy of 97%** in detecting liveness, making it a viable solution for low-risk applications.

## Use cases

ZK Liveness can be used in various scenarios, including:
- **Proof of humanity**: Verifying that a user is a real person, not a bot or an AI.
- **Airdrops**: Ensuring that airdrop participants are real, live users.
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Adding an extra layer of security by verifying the user's liveness during authentication.
- **Online voting**: Ensuring that voters are live participants, preventing vote manipulation through spoofing.
