# Overview

## Why Rarimo?

Digital identity is crucial for bringing the next billion users to the Web3. As an emergent technology, it suffers from some growing pains. Primarily, it's the lack of interoperability among competing standards and fragmentation across the chains and ecosystems.

Rarimo unlocks seamless portability by connecting DApps across multiple chains to a range of issuers and standards and provides enhanced privacy with Zero-Knowledge technology.

## The Rarimo Protocol

The Rarimo Protocol is an interchain base layer consisting of independent validators and oracles. Oracles observe events in the outer world in a trustless way, and validators collaborate to achieve a secure Proof of Stake consensus on the order of events.

Building upon it, Identity and Bridging protocols create a cross-chain digital identity layer for DApps.


## Design Principles

### Compatibility

Rarimo aims to harmonize the de facto industry standards, such as W3C DID credentials, soulbound tokens(SBTs), and existing identity providers. All these identity formats have unique benefits, so the protocol provides tools for interoperability between them. You can use your credentials or tokens on any chain supported by Rarirmo.

### Privacy

The self-sovereign paradigm brings ownership over identities back to the users. No third party has access to the sensitive data. Only you decide what to share and when.

Zero-knowledge technology enables privacy-preserving identity verification both on-chain and off-chain. You can prove specific facts about yourself to DApps without leaking sensitive data. For example, confirming that you're of legal age without disclosing your date of birth or the type of document used to prove it.

The RariMe Split feature adds an extra layer of anonymity and security by allowing you to attach your credentials to separate profiles that can't be traced back to you.

### Standardized Verification

Rarimo facilitates a solid framework for issuing credentials and using them to create on-chain Zero-Knowledge proofs of identity:

- As an identity provider, you get tools and a structured process for issuing and managing credentials;
- As a DApp developer, you can tap into the pool of existing identity providers and credential schemas to verify your users;
- As a user, you can keep all your credentials in RariMe MetaMask snap;

### Cost Efficiency

Cross-chain tech can get expensive for both DApp builders and end users, so the protocol was designed with gas cost optimization in mind.

Rarimo employs TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) to minimize the cost of cross-chain transactions. The overhead is as low as checking a single ECDSA signature.

The on-demand approach to syncing the necessary on-chain data ensures scaling to multiple networks is economically feasible. The identity metadata is lazily propagated to the destination chains only when needed, meaning the expenses depend only on usage, not the number of supported chains.

The gas fees can be paid by either the DApp developer or the end user. As a developer, you have the freedom to balance the user experience and the operational costs.

### Monetization for Issuers

Legacy identity providers have trouble monetizing their services in Web3. Rarimo offers tools for collecting usage-based fees, such as minting soulbond tokens with a limited lifespan.
