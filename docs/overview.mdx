# What is Rarimo?

Rarimo is building a permissionless ZK Registry that redefines how identities, interactions, and social graphs are managed. Unlike traditional identity protocols that depend on centralized issuers or specialized hardware, Rarimo uses client-side proving to deliver a truly censorship-resistant backbone. Instead of striving to build a universal identity, Rarimo embraces a pluralistic approach. This empowers developers to create applications that respect user anonymity while preserving historical interactions and ensuring continuity of identity.

## What is a ZK Registry?

The ZK Registry is a ZK Rollup that functions as an on-chain registry for abstract statements. It enables proving the system's state without revealing details about individual statements. By aggregating standardized, provable statements in a permissionless registry, the ZK Registry provides a flexible foundation for many use cases. Developers can implement protocols like identity verification, reputation, and proof-of-attendance with minimal effort, making it easier to build privacy-preserving applications.

## Why a ZK Rollup?

Rarimo deploys the ZK Registry to a dedicated ZK Rollup to leverage Ethereum's security and interoperability while maintaining affordability and flexibility. Additionally, ZK Registry updates can be propagated to other Layer 1 networks, ensuring seamless synchronization of root states across multiple ecosystems.

## Tools for building privacy-preserving applications

Rarimo provides a suite of tools to help developers build trustless identities and privacy-preserving applications. These tools include:

### ZK Passport for permissionless self-issued identities

ZK Passport Registry transforms biometric passports into unique, privacy-preserving digital identities. Unlike most solutions, it combines decentralized infrastructure, reliable uniqueness verification, and privacy.

Learn more at [ZK Passport](/zk-passport).

### Bionetta for client-side ZKML

Bionetta is a client-side framework for generating private inference proofs using Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning(ZKML).
By focusing on public model weights, Bionetta ensures user inputs remain fully private.
This approach is ideally suited for privacy-preserving use cases such as biometric verification in Web3.

### ZK Reputation for provable credibility

The ZK Reputation Registry allows users to prove their reputation based on private relationships and interactions, without exposing sensitive details. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, users can verify their trustworthiness and standing in various communities while maintaining complete control over their privacy.

## Ecosystem

Several applications are being built on top of Rarimo:

- [**RariMe App**](/rarime-app): A self-sovereign mobile wallet for managing digital identity.
- [**Freedom Tool**](/freedom-tool): A privacy-preserving voting solution designed for e-democracy.

## Launch your own ZK Registry

ZK Registry is entirely open-source and built with extensibility in mind, following [ERC-7812](/zk-registry). If your DApp can benefit from private yet provable data, bring it on!
