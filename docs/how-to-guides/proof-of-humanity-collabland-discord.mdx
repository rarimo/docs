# Protecting your Discord server from bots with Proof of Humanity and Collab.Land
# Protecting your Discord server from bots with Proof of Humanity and Collab.Land

A typical crypto discord server is constantly attacked by bots shilling scams. Banning them manually wastes your mods' and users' time. Basic protection measures, like captcha verification, do little good, either.

![Sample Scam](/img/collabland-guide/sample-scam.png)

Rarimo has developed a free plugin for the popular token-gating bot [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/) to fight this menace. It allows the server admin to set up channels for verified humans only.

## Configuring the Collab.Land bot

### Step #1: Invite the Collab.Land bot

In case you didn't use Collab.Land yet, follow the [Discord Bot Walkthrough](https://collabland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/70000036689-discord-bot-walkthrough) to invite the bot to your server.

### Step #2:  Create a Discord role for humans

Collab.Land's token gating rules are based on discord roles, so we need to create a role for the verified users by following the [Setting Up Permissions FAG](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTVYQ38W9TVCTM6YZHZXFFA) guide.

Let's call our role `Certified Human✅`:

### Step #5: Configure the channels

Now that we have the token-gating rule in place, we can configure the channels that require the `Certified Human✅` role.

Follow the [How do I set up a Role-Exclusive channel?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206143877-How-do-I-set-up-a-Role-Exclusive-channel-#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20%22%2B%22%20icon,have%20access%20to%20this%20channel!) guide to configure the human-only channels.

### Step #6: Instruct your users

Add a greeting message to your `#collabland-join` or other appropriate channel that prompts users to get verified.

## Verification guide for users

Now that the server is configured, let's see how the users can obtain the `Certified Human✅` role.

### Step #1: Start the verification

Call the `/verify` command to start the verification process:
