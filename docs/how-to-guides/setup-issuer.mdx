# Setting Up A Credentials Issuer

This article details the steps to set up a Credentials Issuer, create your credentials schema, and issue the first credentials.

## Installation

Firstly, you will need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a> via the provided link.
Running the app with Docker allows for minimal installation and a quick setup.
Then, you will need to clone <a href="https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/tree/feature/inclusion-mtp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the repository</a> (branch=feature/inclusion-mtp):

<!-- TODO: running with Docker -->


```git clone -b=feature/inclusion-mtp https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node.git```

After cloning the repository, you should do the following:
1. Generate an Ethereum keypair for the Issuer Node. It will be used to sign state transitions on the Rarimo chain.

>Currently, there is no network fee for the state transition transactions. To prevent network abuse, we maintain an allowlist of identity issuers. Contact us in [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/rarimoprotocol) and provide the corresponding Ethereum address to get added to the allowlist.

1. In the folder you've cloned rename `.env-api.example` to `.env-api`, `.env-ui.example` to `.env-ui` and `.env-issuer.example` to `.env-issuer`.
    - `.env-api` is used to configure the api-ui.
    This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the api-ui, the server URL, and others.
    - `.env-ui` is used to configure the api-ui.
    This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the Issuer UI, the server URL, and others.
    - `.env-issuer` is used to configure the api-issuer.
    It contains the needed configuration to start the node, such as the infrastructure configuration (postgres/redis/vault), the blockchain variables to be able to publish the state, the Basic Auth variables, and other variables.
1. In the `.env-issuer` file, you need to set the variable `ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL` to a Rarimo RPC endpoint.
<!-- TODO: provide endpoints -->
1. Run `sudo make build` in the cloned folder
1. Run `sudo make private_key=YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY run-all` with the issuer's private key.
1. Check that `localhost:3001` (Issuer API) and `localhost:3002` (Issuer UI) are available.

## How to create Credentials Schemas

If you need to create your own Credentials Schemas (some of the schemas can be found <a href="https://github.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/tree/main/schemas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) you can use either <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PolygonID Schema Builder</a> (recommended option) or you can write it by yourself and import it, using Issuer UI API.


### Creating a Schema with PolygonID Schema Builder

To create the schema using PolygonID Builder, follow these steps:

1. Enter the title, type, version, and description of your schema
![Schema data](/img/schema-builder-1.png)
1. Define the attributes. Let's add the date of birth and the full name for this example.
![Schema attributes](/img/schema-builder-2.png)
1. After clicking on "Add" button, a new attribute will appear, and you need to change its name, title, type, and description and set the checkbox, whether it is required or not
![New Attribute](/img/schema-builder-3.png)
1. You can also set additional restrictions by clicking on the "Advanced" button
![Advanced settings](/img/schema-builder-4.png)
1. After you've finished, you can copy it from the right window or download it by pressing on the "Download JSON" button below the properties
![Receiving the Schema](/img/schema-builder-5.png)
1. Publish it somewhere (e.g., on GitHub or IPFS) and paste the link into `url` field at the `Import JSON schema` in the Issuer UI API.
You should also copy the type, title, description, and version from the posted schema

## Issuing Credentials

Once the issuer is ready, we can issue our first credentials.

### Using the Issuer UI

1. The Issuer is also an identity, so we need to create one.
To do that, open `localhost:3001` and select "Create Identity" in the left sidebar.
![Identity Creation](/img/issuer-issue-1.png)
1. Fill in the `method`, `blockchain`, and `network` fields.
The `method` field is required.
We will use the method `iden3` without specifying blockchain and network.
We will also create an identity for the user so we can issue credentials to him.
![Identity Created, using iden3 method](/img/issuer-issue-2.png)
1. We can issue our first claim after creating both identities (or receiving the user's identity from him).
To do that, press the "Create Claim" button and paste the Issuer identifier (our first generated ID) and user's ID in the `id` field below:
![Create Claim](/img/issuer-issue-3.png)
1. We can check our claim using the "Get Claim" endpoint:
![Get Claim](/img/issuer-issue-4.png)
1. The last thing we need to do is publish the state of our issuer on-chain
![State publishing](/img/issuer-issue-5.png)
1. Now, we can send to the user MTP of Claim inclusion in the tree, using "Get Claim MTP"

### Issuing via API

API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/blob/main/api/api.yaml).

Follow these steps:
1. Let's issue credentials to the previously created identity:
    - the `authorization` field is Base64 encoded username and password
    - we will change the `id` (receiver's did), `birthday` and `expiration` fields
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/credentials" \
    -H "accept: application/json"\
    -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp"\
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "credentialSchema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json",
        "type": "KYCAgeCredential",
        "credentialSubject":{
            "id":"did:iden3:tQdm5KtrBAsQApF5445Wo4p8f1D5QKmAEpKWSxQaG",
            "birthday": 20000101,
            "documentType": 2
            },
        "expiration": "2023-10-27T10:56:42.618Z",
        "signatureProof": true,
        "mtProof": true }'
    ```
    The response would be the credentials ID:
    ```
    {
        "id": "b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007"
    }
    ```
1. After credentials are issued, we can publish our issuer's identity state on-chain:
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/state/publish" \
    -H "accept: application/json"\
    -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp"
    ```
    The response would be the new state, new tree roots and the txID:
    ```json
    {
        "claimsTreeRoot": "c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
        "revocationTreeRoot": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "rootOfRoots": "2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
        "state": "6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819",
        "txID": "0xbde3732071c9947d43a46175e47b6604b924e273ce86898f76ff621b6e48691b"
    }
    ```
1. Finally, we can make a request to the Issuer API and check that credentials exist in the tree and also receive the MTP of existence:

   ```
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/v1/claims/b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007/mtp" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
   ```

    The response would be the information about the issuer and MTP (of existence in our case):

    ```json
     {
         "issuer":{
             "claimTreeRoot": "c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
             "revocationTreeRoot": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
             "rootOfRoots": "2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
             "state": "6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819"
         },
         "mtp":{
             "existence": true,
             "siblings":[
                 "10737733873451827385669539393513485246847702080273815461038732999844382514192"
             ]
         }
     }
    ```
