# Freedom Tool

Rarimo has built the Freedom Tool to enable decentralized and privacy-preserving voting. Its core parts are mobile apps for Android and iOS capable of scanning biometric passports, ZK circuits for verifying passport validity without exposing personal data, and a set of Solidity smart contracts that verify the ZK proofs and handle the voting process.
