# Using Proof of Humanity off-chain

Off-chain applications like Discord bots, quest platform backends, and many others can benefit from Proof of Humanity(PoH) integration.

To integrate it, redirect your users to the <OutLink href="https://robotornot.rarimo.com/">PoH DApp</OutLink> to verify their humanity. Then, you can check their verification status using one of the following methods.

## Option #1: GraphQL endpoint(recommended)

Rarimo indexes the verified users using a subgraph. You can query its GraphQL endpoint to check the verification status like this:

1. Run the following GraphQL query:

   **Endpoint**:
   https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/volodymyrzolotukhin/sbtidentityverifier-polygon

   **Query**:

   ```graphql
   query info($address: String!) {
     users(where: { senderAddr: $address }) {
       id
     }
   }
   ```

   Use this verified address for tests: `0x62019b7b8f7d5b58006c5001eb1ffa95ab191474`

1. Verify that the response looks like this:

   ```json
   {
       "users": [
           {
               "id": ": "19643409028078272448762374992644569744201332795590556384983511405206634497"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Assume the user is verified if the `users` array is non-empty.

## Option #2: NFT indexer

If you operate an NFT indexer already, you can also use it to check the user verification. Just check that the user owns a PoH soulbound token.
