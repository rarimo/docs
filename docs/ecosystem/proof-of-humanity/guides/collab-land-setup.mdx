# Protecting your discord server from bots with Proof of Humanity and Collab.Land

A typical crypto discord server is constantly attacked by bots shilling scams. Banning them manually wastes your mods' and users' time. Basic protection measures, like captcha verification, do little good, either.

![Sample Scam](/img/collabland-guide/sample-scam.png)

Rarimo has developed a free plugin for the popular token-gating bot [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/) to fight this menace. It allows the server admin to set up channels for verified humans only.

## Configuring the Collab.Land bot

### Step #1: Invite the Collab.Land bot

In case you didn't use Collab.Land yet, follow the [Discord Bot Walkthrough](https://collabland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/70000036689-discord-bot-walkthrough) to invite the bot to your server.

### Step #2: Create a Discord role for humans

Collab.Land's token gating rules are based on discord roles, so we need to create a role for the verified users by following the [Setting Up Permissions FAG](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTVYQ38W9TVCTM6YZHZXFFA) guide.

Let's call our role `Certified Human✅`:

### Step #3: Add the Proof of Humanity action

1. Open the [Collab.Land Command Center](https://cc.collab.land/login):

1. Fill in the following fields and verify that the screenshot below matches your form:
   - Chain: `Polygon`;
   - Token Type: `ERC721`;
   - Addresses: `0xaD7De01cb7eaAFf3a419A0a0a3133a964cD90373`([reference](/ecosystem/proof-of-humanity/smart-contracts-reference#deployments));
     ![TGRs Config](/img/collabland-guide/tgr-config.png)
1. Click **Save** and verify that you see the following screen:

### Step #5: Configure the channels

Now that we have the token-gating rule in place, we can configure the channels that require the `Certified Human✅` role.

![Create Human-Only Channel](/img/collabland-guide/create-human-channel.png)

Follow the [How do I set up a Role-Exclusive channel?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206143877-How-do-I-set-up-a-Role-Exclusive-channel-#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20%22%2B%22%20icon,have%20access%20to%20this%20channel!) guide to configure the human-only channels.

### Step #6: Guide your users

Add a greeting message to your `#collabland-join` or other appropriate channel that prompts users to get verified.

## Verification guide for users

Now that the server is configured, let's see how the users can obtain the `Certified Human✅` role.

### Step #1: Start the verification

Call the `/rarimo-verify` command to start the verification process:

![Call /rarimo-verify](/img/collabland-guide/call-verify.png)

### Step #2: Complete the Proof of Humanity verification

Users who completed the Proof of Humanity verification earlier can skip this step.

After clicking the **Verify Your Humanity** button, you will be redirected to the [Prove Your Humanity](https://robotornot.rarimo.com) page. Follow the instructions to complete the verification.

### Step #3: Claim the verified role

Once you've completed the verification, go to the `#collabland-join` channel and click on the **Let's go** button to obtain your verified role:
