# API reference

This page contains technical resources related to the World ID State Replication.

## Identity relayer

This service replicates identity states on demand.
It should be called before submitting proof on the destination chain.

For the full implementation, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rarimo/worldcoin-relayer-svc).
For more information about API, see [Identity transfers](https://rarimo.github.io/rarimo-core/docs/common/bridging/002-identity.html).

### Relayer endpoints

To perform state publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/state/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Avalanche",
  "hash": "0x212bc6f8194aa63eee97b0566b7cd65c66bb57cc4936c11e611f1042bb0b7118",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

- `"chain": "chain_name"` - chain, to which the state will be relayed;
- `"hash": "0x..."` - hash of the state to relay. Same as on the state contract in 0x... hex format;
- `"waitConfirm": true` indicates whether the request should wait until the transaction is included in the block (`false` by default);

The response codes:

- `200` - successful relay, body contains tx hash;
- `404` - the state is not transferred yet; try to repeat the request later;
- `400` - state has been relayed before;
