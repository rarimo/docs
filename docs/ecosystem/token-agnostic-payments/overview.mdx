# Token-agnostic payments

Sometimes, Web3 payments may be overwhelming: so many popular tokens, chains, and steps are involved. This abundance of options unnecessarily complicates your product and spoils the user experience. With Rarimo's token-agnostic payments, your customers can pay in any fungible token with just a few clicks. We handle the token swaps and bridging for you.

Fundamentally, the product provides four capabilities:

- Cross-chain bridging of assets backed by Rarimo Protocol;
- Token swaps using liquidity from popular DEXes such as Uniswap, PancackeSwap, and TraderJoe;
- [Rarimo's bundling technology](/products/bridging-protocol/guide-how-to-bundle-transactions/) allows the inclusion of custom logic into transactions. Rarimo contracts use this logic to run actions that follow an initial transaction, such as unlocking tokens on other chains and buying NFTs;
- [Circle CCTP integration](/products/bridging-protocol/circle-cctp-integration/) provides USDC liquidity for all supported chains;

By combining these features, developers can implement such cross-chain use cases as fungible token payments, NFT minting, staking, token swaps, etc.

## User journey

Let's walk through a <OutLink href="https://nft-checkout.rarimo.com/">demo</OutLink> and buy an NFT priced in ETH with a fungible token stored on another chain to see how it works.

1. Open the demo page <OutLink href="https://nft-checkout.rarimo.com/">NFT Checkout demo</OutLink>

2. Click "Purchase with any token" and connect your Metamask

   <IdealImage img={require('/img/token-agnostic-walletconnection.png')} alt="Token-agnostic wallet" />

3. Select the token you want to pay with(in this case, it's UNI)

   <IdealImage img={require('/img/token-agnostic-tokens.png')} alt="Token-agnostic tokens" />

4. Check out the estimated fees and proceed to the checkout

   <IdealImage img={require('/img/token-agnostic-receipt.png')} alt="Token-agnostic reciept" />

5. Approve the token spending for the Rarimo swap contract

   <IdealImage img={require('/img/token-agnostic-swap.png')} alt="Token-agnostic swap" />

6. Confirm the swap of UNI to WETH

   <IdealImage img={require('/img/token-agnostic-swap-confirm.png')} alt="Token-agnostic swap confirm" />

7. â€¦and, that's it! Rarimo Relayer will pick up the transaction and automatically complete the purchase of the NFT in the destination network
