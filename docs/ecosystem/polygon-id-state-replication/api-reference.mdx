# Polygon ID State Replication: API reference

This page contains technical resources related to the [Polygon ID State Replication](/ecosystem/polygon-id-state-replication).

## Demo DApp

Users can check out how the state replication works using our demo DApp. Leveraging the state replication lets users submit a Polygon ID zero-knowledge proof on Ethereum. Users get an SBT as a reward.

## Identity relayer

This service replicates GIST roots and identity states on demand.
Call it before submitting proof on the destination chain.

### Relayer endpoints

To perform state publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/state/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Ethereum",
  "hash": "0x212bc6f8194aa63eee97b0566b7cd65c66bb57cc4936c11e611f1042bb0b7118",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

To perform GIST publishing, you can execute POST `/integrations/relayer/gist/relay` request with the following body:

```json
{
  "chain": "Ethereum",
  "hash": "0x1e4b74c14388fbfca27496828d24c248637792eb0286e7519860abb3ec01bc70",
  "waitConfirm": true
}
```

- `"chain": "chain_name"` - chain, to which the state (or gist) will be relayed;
- `"hash": "0x..."` - hash of the state (or gist) to relay. Same as on the state contract in 0x... hex format;
- `"waitConfirm": true` indicates whether the request should wait until the transaction is included in the block (`false` by default);

The response codes:

- `200` - successful relay, body contains tx hash;
- `404` - the state is not transferred yet; try to repeat the request later;
- `400` - state has been relayed before;
